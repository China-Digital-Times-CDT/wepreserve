## Vigils and Mourning
- Three-day citywide mourning (Nov 29–Dec 1): flags at half-mast across government sites and overseas offices; condolence books open in all 18 districts; public hotlines for casualty inquiries and mental health support (SCMP).
- On-site memorials and note removals reported; residents continued placing messages nearby.
- Mourners at Wang Fuk Court displayed placards reading “要检讨嘅唔系竹棚 而系个制度” (“Review the system, not the bamboo”), rejecting attempts to blame bamboo scaffolding for the spread (RFI).
- WSJ described thousands gathering on Dec 1 to lay flowers and donate supplies; ad-hoc relief booths were later replaced by police command tents as authorities formalized the site ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).

## Accountability Actions
- Petitions/leaflets: Arrests of student Miles Kwan (petition >10k signatures), former district councillor Kenneth Cheung, and volunteer surnamed Li over accountability leaflets/messages (RFI/HKFP).
- Protests/vigils calling for independent investigation; police/security officials warned against “misinformation.”
- National security posture: Beijing’s national-security office warned it would punish anyone “exploiting” the fire for political ends, accused “anti-China” actors of spreading false information, and threatened arrests of those directing anger at the government. A person distributing fliers for an independent inquiry was detained and later bailed ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).
- Disappearances/online takedowns: Threads/X accounts of Hailey Cheng (a.k.a. 金冬菇, founder of the GitHub “Hong Kong Fire Documentary” project) were removed early Dec 3; her phone unreachable, prompting fears she was taken for questioning over “seditious” information ([Threads](https://www.threads.com/@bravedogdog/post/DRxuZY8DOEH?xmt=AQF0lSY3idOhbSWh9l93EEyPuDBCKVB3sWO-7wYF0_7GxA)).
- Election context: Government said Dec 7 LegCo campaign activities would pause while authorities address the fire; activists’ online petition echoed 2019 protest demands, and rights groups warned the National Security Law chills discussion of the disaster (WSJ).
- Civil society presser (Dec 2) on high-rise repair policy canceled after organizer Law Shing-lai (ADPL) met National Security police under confidentiality; agenda included inquiry demand, materials violations, oversight, bid-rigging concerns; organizers say groups must “appropriately” voice stances ([InMediaHK](https://www.inmediahk.net/node/%E6%94%BF%E7%B6%93/%E3%80%90%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%E3%80%91%E6%B0%91%E9%96%93%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E6%9C%83%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88-%E5%BB%96%E6%88%90%E5%88%A9%E8%A2%AB%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%89%E8%99%95%E9%82%80%E6%9C%83%E9%9D%A2%EF%BC%9A%E5%B7%B2%E7%B0%BD%E4%BF%9D%E5%AF%86%E5%8D%94%E8%AD%B0%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E9%80%8F%E9%9C%B2?utm_source=dable)).
- Owners’ committee accountability: DAB-linked advisor Wong Bik-kiu vows police/ICAC reports over alleged misconduct and safety risks; highlights man-made disaster framing and calls for full accountability (DotDotNews/HK01).
- Public commentary on accountability: Threads posts highlight lack of official resignations after ~200 dead/missing and cite AFP question to John Lee (“Can you tell us why you deserve to keep your job?”) ([Threads](https://www.threads.com/@kaminghk/post/DRxEWgCj7mz?xmt=AQF0Y8QlE4EeoRWNRx0-ZokkHaRfuw3I-2LSifPZ25bpOQ)).
