- **2017** FactWire publishes a building-maintenance bidding database (~3,000 bids across 220 estates) showing widespread bid-rigging patterns—context for later Wang Fuk Court tender concerns [FactWire](https://www.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/01/AP692d69ede4b0c32d4f618e05.html).
- **2023** After the MBIS tender is set, projected costs rise from ~HK$140m to HK$330m; residents allege bid-rigging and report suspected triad-linked figures blocking dissenting owners from meetings.

- **2024-05-17** Contractor and whistleblower Jason Poon (Pan Zhuohong) reports use of non-compliant scaffolding netting at Wang Fuk Court, recording videos and sending multiple emails to the Fire Services Director; concerns reportedly not acted on.
- **2024-07** Owners' briefing on the HK$330m repair: residents object to rushed scope and lack of consultation; a lawyer warns that stopping the contract after a committee change could trigger owner liability. Residents say they tipped ICAC before contract signing but were told to supply evidence and saw no probe ([i-Cable](https://www.i-cable.com/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E8%B3%87%E8%A8%8A/415811/%E4%B8%80%E7%B7%9A%E6%90%9C%E6%9F%A5-%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB%E8%83%8C%E5%BE%8C-%E4%B8%89%E7%96%91%E9%BB%9E%E6%83%B9%E9%97%9C%E6%B3%A8-%E5%B1%85%E6%B0%91)).
- **2024-09** Residents complain to the Labor Department about flammable scaffolding netting and foam boards sealing windows; department initially says netting not regulated, later cites contractor certificates and notes 16 inspections with notices/prosecutions but allows works to continue [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-warned.html).

Later police sampling across multiple blocks finds 7 of 20 netting samples fail flammability tests; harder-to-reach samples fail more often, raising mixing/switching suspicions [RTHK](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1834099-20251201.htm).
- **2025-12-01** Ngon Kei Court residents say contractor Wai Lei Construction torched scaffold-net samples on-site; some pieces ignited immediately. Consultant Hung Ngai (same as Wang Fuk Court) blamed possible glue drips; residents fear safety risks and urge replacing the consultant despite cost concerns for the HK$150m major repair ([HKEJ](https://www.hkej.com/instantnews/current/article/4260928/%E5%AE%89%E5%9F%BA%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%B6%AD%E4%BF%AE+%E6%89%BF%E5%BB%BA%E5%95%86%E9%BB%9E%E7%87%83%E6%A3%9A%E7%B6%B2%E9%83%A8%E5%88%86%E6%9C%AA%E8%83%BD%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E%E6%B8%AC%E8%A9%A6)).

## Analysis & Commentary

### Fire Spread & Technical Analysis

- **2025-12-02** BBC visual guide maps spread: traces fire origin to Wang Cheong House, spread to six more blocks within ~90 minutes, notes 44-hour suppression to 10:18 a.m. Nov 28, alarms failing in all eight towers, and highlights flammable foam boards/netting and bamboo scaffold collapse contributing to propagation (BBC visual explainer).
- **2025-12-02** Grenfell inquiry expert José Luis Torero tells HKEJ/Yahoo the blaze resembles Grenfell in vertical spread and smoke overrunning escape routes; suspects combustible foam/polystyrene cladding and channel-flow between towers as main drivers rather than bamboo alone; calls for a Grenfell-level technical probe into materials, compartmentation, spacing, and smoke-path failure ([Yahoo/信報](https://hk.finance.yahoo.com/news/%E8%8B%B1%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BD%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%A5%E5%B0%88%E5%AE%B6-%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%A4%B1%E6%95%88%E7%8C%9B%E6%96%BC%E7%81%AB-2017%E5%80%AB%E6%95%A6%E4%BD%8F%E5%AE%85%E5%A4%A7%E5%BB%88%E7%87%92%E9%80%9A%E9%A0%82-%E8%88%87%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E7%9B%B8%E4%BC%BC-184700834.html)).

### Political & Systemic Analysis

- **2025-12-02** Global Voices opinion argues negligence and MBIS oversight failures—not bamboo—drove the disaster; cites HK$330m tender controversies, ignored complaints about flammable netting/foam, 43-hour burn, and suppression of calls for an independent investigation (Global Voices).
- **2025-12-02** AP analysis flags "tip of an iceberg": notes 7 of 20 net samples failed, cost-cutting net swaps after a typhoon, alarms not sounding, and suspension of 28 other projects by the same contractor; political analysts warn of systemic bid-rigging/oversight gaps and national-security arrests of petition organizers amid public anger ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-wang-china-dissent-fire-construction-ff953aec2bc0201b0e3255805a241fc1)).
- **2025-12-02** Foreign Policy column says the fire underscores Hong Kong's loss of freedoms: authorities suppressed civil aid and detained petitioners; independent inquiries like Grenfell's are now impossible under NSL, making Hong Kong's response mirror the mainland ([Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/12/02/hong-kong-apartment-fire-china-political-freedoms/)).
- **2025-12-13** The Atlantic argues bamboo scapegoating misses systemic causes: elite-contractor collusion and deregulated housing markets since 1997, flammable foam/window cladding and non-compliant netting, possible alarm deactivation, and suppressed petitions/mourning (sedition arrests, campus poster removals, media "warning" meeting); warns Hong Kong is moving toward Beijing-style repression with low-turnout "patriots-only" elections ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2025/12/hong-kong-fire-investigation/685204/)).
