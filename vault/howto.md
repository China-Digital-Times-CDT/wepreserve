## Archive single pages

- Internet Archive (https://archive.org/web/)
    - We strongly suggest your installing [the Internet Archive plugin for browsers](https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback-machine-webextension) to save any web pages handily. 
- Webrecorder Archive (https://webrecorder.net/tools#archivewebpage)

## Archive the whole site

If you are a developer, you can run up this docker container(https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) to save a web site as a whole. The saved site will be compressed into a single file as a snapshot from the specific date(time). The file is in a popular compression format called [WACZ](https://webrecorder.github.io/wacz-spec/1.1.1/).
