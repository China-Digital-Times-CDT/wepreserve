香港中文大學學生會（英語：Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong），是曾於香港中文大學運作的學生會。根據《香港中文大學學生會會章》，其宗旨為「本民主自治精神，為團結各同學，促進德、智、體、群、美之發展，謀求福利之增進，溝通同學與校方之關係，以及服務社會」。該會成立於1971年3月19日，2021年10月7日，中大學生會於其 Facebook 專頁宣布，考量學生最大利益下，決定解散學生會，代表會所有代表請辭，惟相關解散宣告及後於2021年11月7日被司法委員會推翻。2021年11月7日，司法委員會裁定中文大學學生會代表會及/或學生會聯席會議解散學生會之宣告違憲並無效，且宣布中文大學學生會聯席會議應該重啟學生會職務。(FB page: https://www.facebook.com/CUHK.SU)

The Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong is a student union that used to operate in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. According to the Charter of the Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, its mission is "to unite students in the spirit of democratic self-government, to promote moral, intellectual, physical, social and aesthetic development, to seek the advancement of welfare, to communicate with the University, and to serve the community". On 7 October 2021, the Student Union announced on its Facebook page that it had decided to dissolve the union in the best interests of students and that all representatives of the Student Union had resigned, but the dissolution was subsequently overturned by the Judicial Committee on 7 November 2021. On 7 November 2021, the Judicial Committee ruled that the dissolution of the Student Union by the Representative Council and/or the Conference was unconstitutional and invalid, and declared that the Conference of Student Union should re-activate the Student Union.
