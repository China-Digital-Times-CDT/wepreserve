The Hong Kong Information Technology Workers' Union (HKITWU; Chinese: 香港資訊科技界工會) was a trade union of IT workers in Hong Kong. It was affiliated with the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which also dissolved in 2021. The trade union was founded during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, together with other trade unions. During the protests, the trade union developed a database of employers that would not threaten or dismiss staff for taking part in the protests. (URL: https://hkitwu.org/)
