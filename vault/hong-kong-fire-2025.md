A catastrophic fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, Hong Kong, resulted in at least 156 fatalities and left hundreds missing. Authorities are investigating the incident, citing gross negligence by construction officials as a potential cause.

The blaze, which began around 3 p.m. on November 26, 2025, rapidly spread across seven high-rise buildings, triggering a level 5 alarm and a massive emergency response involving more than 800 firefighters and paramedics. Many of the deceased were elderly residents trapped inside the burning structures, and authorities are still working to account for approximately 279 individuals who remain uncontactable.

Officials say the rapid spread of the fire was exacerbated by highly flammable polystyrene materials used in ongoing renovations that blocked windows and escape routes. One firefighter was among the dead, and several others were treated for heat exhaustion during the rescue effort.

## Key Facts
- Location: Wang Fuk Court housing complex, Tai Po, Hong Kong; ~2,000 apartments housing ~4,600 residents (c.40% aged 65+ per 2021 census)
- Date: November 26, 2025 (first report ~2:51 p.m.; escalated to level 5)
- Impact: At least 156 fatalities; 29 remain unidentified; about 30 people still unaccounted; injuries reported at 79 including 12 firefighters; one firefighter (age 37) confirmed dead
- Scale: Fire spread across seven of eight high-rise buildings (all but Wang Chi House); >800 firefighters and paramedics deployed, with 200 fire trucks and 100 ambulances dispatched early
- Contributing factors: Highly flammable polystyrene and substandard scaffolding netting used in renovations blocked windows and escape routes; windows in elevator lobbies reportedly sealed with foam boards; netting allegedly swapped to bypass inspections; fire alarms later found non-functional across all towers (some residents say alarms were switched off during works)
- Tender and oversight concerns: Under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme, the renovation price reportedly jumped from HK$140m to HK$330m; residents alleged bid-rigging, triad-linked interference at owners’ meetings, and unanswered complaints about flammable mesh/foam that sealed windows; disqualified pro-democracy district councillors who tried to help were expelled (RFI).
- Investigations: 15 arrests for manslaughter tied to alleged gross negligence; ICAC probe with eight arrests linked to the renovation project; officials say seven of 20 netting samples failed safety standards (NBC/AP)
- Governance response: Chief Executive John Lee announced an independent judge-led committee (non-statutory) to review the incident and recommend reforms to the building renovation system; government sources say statutory powers will be replaced by administrative directives to supply evidence

- Information control: Beijing’s national-security office warned it would punish anyone “exploiting” the fire, accusing “anti-China” groups of spreading falsehoods; ad-hoc donation booths were replaced by police tents, and the government paused Dec 7 LegCo campaign activities while citing the fire response ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).

- Expert clarification: PolyU associate professor Xinyan Huang (Building Environment and Energy Engineering) issued a Nov 30 statement correcting and contextualizing his Channel 4 interview—bamboo scaffolding role requires systematic study; rapid spread observation lacked detailed investigation; wrongly said mainland fire engines assisted; cites need for cautious public commentary.

In the wake of the tragedy, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an "all-out effort" to extinguish the fire and minimize casualties. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee emphasized that the immediate priority is to rescue any remaining residents trapped inside the buildings.

As investigations unfold, three men from the construction company involved in the renovations have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, with authorities citing gross negligence as a key factor in the fire's rapid escalation. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has also launched a probe, resulting in eight arrests linked to the renovation project, including project managers and subcontractors.

By December 2, police reported 15 total manslaughter arrests after discovering exterior scaffolding netting failed fire-resistance standards and was allegedly swapped to evade inspections. John Lee pledged a judge-led independent committee to review the incident but, according to government sources [Tweet](https://x.com/haileyhmt/status/1995860431177449729?s=46), ruled out a statutory Independent Commission of Inquiry, promising to personally use administrative directives so the non-statutory committee can obtain evidence quickly. Authorities continued to search for 30 unaccounted individuals and identify 29 of the dead. Public grief has been met with arrests of residents and activists calling for accountability, including reports of detentions over leaflets and petitions, with police and the security chief warning against alleged online misinformation [RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20251201-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BE%E5%BD%93%E5%B1%80%E4%B8%A5%E6%89%93%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C-%E8%99%9A%E5%81%87%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF-%E4%B8%A4%E5%A4%A9%E6%8D%95%E4%B8%89%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E6%8B%9B%E6%A0%87%E5%8F%97%E5%85%B3%E6%B3%A8-%E4%BA%B2%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A7%E5%85%9A%E6%B0%91%E5%BB%BA%E8%81%94%E6%80%A5%E5%88%87%E5%89%B2?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=threads&utm_source=shorty&utm_slink=rfi.my%2FCEOr) and officials warning about rumor-mongering [NBC/AP](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-say-netting-buildings-did-not-meet-code-rcna246719?link_source=ta_thread_link&taid=692d8cbebc95c000011633a6&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=threads.net).

Community leaders have expressed outrage over the incident, demanding accountability and a thorough investigation into the safety practices of construction companies in Hong Kong. Public anger is mounting, with protests calling for an independent investigation into the causes of the fire and the systemic issues within the construction industry. Authorities have also accused "anti-China forces" of exploiting the tragedy for political gain, further complicating the narrative surrounding the event.
