社會民主連線（英語：League of Social Democrats），簡稱社民連（LSD），是香港一個以左翼為意識形態的民主派政黨。社民連成立於2006年10月1日，機關刊物是《抗命》。(URL: https://www.lsd.org.hk/)

Established in 2006 by a group of pro-grassroots left-leaning activists, the party opposes the perceived moderate and compromising approach of its pro-democratic allies Democratic Party and Civic Party and called for more aggressive tactics to achieve democracy. It often found itself at odds with other pan-democrats due to its confrontational and radical activism in the Legislative Council. (URL: https://www.lsd.org.hk/)
