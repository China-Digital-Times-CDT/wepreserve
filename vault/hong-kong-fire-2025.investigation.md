## Findings and Evidence
- Scaffolding netting: Police collected 20 samples across Wang Tai, Wang Do, Wang Yan, Wang Chi; 7 failed flammability tests, with harder-to-reach samples more likely to fail, raising mixing/switching suspicions (NBC/AP, RTHK). ICAC says contractors bought ~2,300 rolls of non-compliant mesh at HK$54/roll after typhoon damage, then 115 rolls of compliant mesh at HK$100/roll installed at scaffold bases to pass spot checks (news.gov.hk).
- Foam/polystyrene: Panels sealed windows (incl. elevator lobbies), accelerating spread; melted at >500C and blew out windows (Reuters/CNN).
- Alarms: Post-fire inspections found alarms non-functional across all eight towers; some residents say alarms switched off during works (CNN/BBC).
- Spread origin: Initial outbreak on lower exterior of Wang Cheong House; spread to Wang Tai, Wang Shing, Wang Yan; Wang Chi largely spared (Guardian/Reuters).
- Temperature and access: Interior temps reported above 500C; falling scaffolding and debris hindered rescues (CNN/Reuters/AP).
- Resident account: Survivor Yip Ka-kui described hearing bamboo poles “explode” and mesh igniting before foam-sealed windows trapped his wife Bai Shui Lin, who died after warning neighbors ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hong-kong-apartment-fire-survivor-wife/)).
- Policy responses: Mainland authorities ordered a nationwide inspection of high-rises—especially under renovation with bamboo/wood scaffolding and non-flame-retardant nets—while Hong Kong said 7 of 20 netting samples failed and signaled a gradual shift toward metal scaffolding without blaming bamboo alone ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).

## Tender Irregularities and Oversight Gaps
- Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS): The Wang Fuk Court renovation was commissioned under the 2012 MBIS; after the 2023 tender the price jumped from an estimated HK$140m to HK$330m (RFI).
- Alleged bid-rigging and interference: Residents reported suspected triad-linked individuals blocking dissenting owners from meetings; a new owners’ corporation replaced the old one in Sep 2024 after the contract was already signed (RFI).
- Complaints ignored: During works, residents complained to multiple departments about flammable mesh and foam sealing windows but “got nowhere”; disqualified pro-democracy district councillors who tried to assist were expelled for lacking official status (RFI).
- Historical context: FactWire’s 2017 database (3,000 bids across 220 estates) highlighted systemic bid-rigging patterns in building maintenance—low consultant fees, market concentration, irregular pricing—mirroring current suspicions [FactWire](https://www.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/01/AP692d69ede4b0c32d4f618e05.html).

## Arrests and Probes
- Manslaughter: 15 arrested on gross negligence related to renovation works; early arrests included contractor directors/consultant; later arrests expanded to scaffolding subcontractors and intermediary.
- ICAC: Probe arrested 8 linked to renovation project (directors, project managers, subcontractors, intermediary); total 12 arrests reported including consultants, contractors, scaffolding heads (news.gov.hk).
- Materials: Police and officials allege flammable mesh/foam used; some netting initially certified compliant; ongoing verification of actual materials used on-site.
- Non-statutory review: Chief Executive John Lee announced a judge-led committee (non-statutory), pledging administrative directives for evidence access; statutory Independent Commission of Inquiry was rejected despite civic calls (RFI).

## Open Questions
- Certification vs. installed materials: extent of material swapping; chain of custody for mesh/foam procurement.
- Alarm status pre-fire: whether systems were intentionally disabled during works and by whom.
- Regulatory oversight: adequacy of 16 prior inspections and enforcement actions before November 2025.

## Official Statements and Gaps
- John Lee (Dec 2 presser) acknowledged systemic deficiencies, promised reforms and accountability, and said fires occur globally; condemned “hostile” acts exploiting the tragedy. Deferred on scaffold sampling accuracy while citing ongoing Buildings Department checks ([InMediaHK](https://www.inmediahk.net/node/%E6%94%BF%E7%B6%93/%E3%80%90%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%E3%80%91%E8%A2%AB%E5%95%8F%E7%82%BA%E4%BD%95%E5%80%BC%E5%BE%97%E7%95%99%E4%BB%BB-%E6%9D%8E%E5%AE%B6%E8%B6%85%E7%A8%B1%E7%84%A1%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%98%E8%A6%8B%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB-%E9%9C%80%E6%94%B9%E9%9D%A9%E7%B4%AF%E7%A9%8D%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C)).
- Eight reform questions (John Lee): construction safety requirements/maintenance; conflicts of interest and collusion across project stages; completeness of safety standards and testing; roles and accountability of regulators (government and professionals); risks of corruption/bid-rigging and tender violations; fire-system supervision and responsibility; attribution of liability for the blaze; adequacy of current penalties (RFI).
- Bamboo scapegoating dispute: Mourning visitors and experts argued bamboo scaffolding was not the spread driver; on-site placards read “要检讨嘅唔系竹棚 而系个制度” (“The problem to review isn’t bamboo, it’s the system”). Development Bureau later said its metal-scaffold roadmap was misread as blaming bamboo; PolyU’s Xinyan Huang apologized for Channel 4 remarks and said bamboo’s role needs systematic study (RFI/PolyU).

## Prior Warnings
- Jason Poon (Pan Zhuohong) flagged non-compliant netting via videos/emails on 2024-05-17; warning video circulated (Facebook).
- Resident complaints in Sep 2024 to the Labor Department about flammable netting and foam boards; department initially said netting not regulated, later cited contractor certificates after 16 inspections and issued notices/prosecutions (NYT).
