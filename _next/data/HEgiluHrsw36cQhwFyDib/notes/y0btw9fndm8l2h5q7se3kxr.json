Door camera footage shows she and Maryan left their flat at 3:13 p.m. on Nov 26 (within 3 minutes of Maryan detecting the fire) when corridors were still smoke-free; within 5 minutes the 24/F elevator lobby was engulfed in dense smoke.

Police confirmed her mother's death the next morning. Lo wonders if the tragedy could have been avoided had departments done better; says what bothers her most is lack of transparency on when she can see her burnt apartment and how the HK$589m relief fund will be used. Hopes the nine-month investigation will release findings. Made turnip cakes for Lunar New Year—a tradition inherited from her mother—and said in tears: \"Maybe she is still everywhere and still seeing us now.

In response to the sweeping shutdowns caused by political changes in Hong Kong, we aim to safeguard digital heritage before it vanishes. This project is anonymous, open source, and supported by a global network of contributors.\n\nWhile most sites in our archive were forced offline due to Hong Kong’s political deterioration, it’s important to note that [[RFA Cantonese|sites.rfa_cantonese]] is the only site here closed not because of Hong Kong’s situation, but due to internal political decisions in the United States.\n\nExplore our full list of preserved sites and archives on the [Collections page](/notes/wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u/).\n\nRecent work: documenting the [[hong-kong-fire-2025|Hong Kong Fire 2025]] tragedy at Wang Fuk Court (168 dead, ongoing probes into flammable mesh/foam, bid-rigging, and a judge-led review), including activism, timeline, and investigation subpages; and the [[jimmy-lai|⚖️ Jimmy Lai case]] — Apple Daily founder sentenced to 20 years under the National Security Law (Feb 2026), with coverage of press freedom impact and international response.\n\n## Goals\n- To preserve as much information as possible before its disappearance during Hong Kong's great transition\n- To illustrate a viable method that everyone can use to help preserve online heritage with no pains\n- To demonstrate global collaborations to save local digital heritages with best practices\n\n## Quick Facts\n\nWe are working on over dozens of [[websites or online causes | sites]] in Hong Kong in the past two decades which has been forced to shutdown or at the brink of disappearing.
