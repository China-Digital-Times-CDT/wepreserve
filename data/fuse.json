Over the years, he tracked and exposed information on directors, executives, and advisors of Hong Kong-listed companies, advocating for information disclosure and minority shareholder rights. Through his sophisticated database and rigorous investigative reporting, he revealed capital operation relationships between companies such as the \"Enigma Network,\" and maintained a long-term focus on related-party transactions, hidden loans, and share dilution issues. He refused to blindly trust markets or regulators, emphasizing that investors should do their own homework and think independently.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with cancer and entering the final stage of his life, Webb announced he would orderly shut down Webb-site.com, but as a final gift to the public, he promised to release the website's complete database and self-developed data collection tools to a GitHub public repository for free use. He also emphasized that he would not authorize anyone to continue operating the website, to prevent his legacy from being misused to promote scams, misinformation, or positions he disagreed with. This decision demonstrated his consistent principles and commitment to Hong Kong's market order, allowing Webb-site's spirit to continue rather than be distorted.\n\nIn October 2025, the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/david-webb-hong-kong-webb-site-china-communist-party-business-034a3718) on the challenges Webb faced in finding a home for his database. His first approach was to the University of Hong Kong, where professors supported establishing an apolitical \"Webb Centre for Public Transparency\" to host and expand the database. Webb and other donors were prepared to fund it entirely. However, after the formal proposal was presented to senior management in September 2020, the university declined the offer. Keith Richburg, then director of the university's Journalism and Media Studies Centre, speculated the reason was they thought it \"would be troublesome\" — likely due to concerns about the 2020 national-security law and the political sensitivities of maintaining such transparent databases on Hong Kong and mainland business connections.\n\nOn January 13, 2026, David Webb [passed away peacefully in Hong Kong](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1839713-20260113.htm) from metastatic prostate cancer at the age of 60. He is survived by his wife and two children.\n\nDavid Webb 所創立的財經網站 Webb-site，自 1998 年起成為香港企業治理和股市透明度的重要監察平台。他多年來追蹤並揭露香港上市公司董事、高管及顧問的資料，致力於促進資訊公開與小股東權益。他以其精密的數據庫與嚴謹的調查報導，揭示如「謎網」等企業之間的資本運作關係，並長期關注關聯交易、隱藏貸款及股權稀釋等問題。他拒絕盲目相信市場或監管機構，強調投資人應自己做功課、獨立思考。\n\n在罹患癌症、生命進入倒數階段後，Webb 宣布將有序關閉 Webb-site.com，但作為留給公眾的最後禮物，他承諾會把網站的完整資料庫和自研數據收集工具，開放至 GitHub 公共儲存庫，供後人自由使用。他同時強調，不會授權他人延續網站的營運，避免其精神被濫用為推廣詐騙、假資訊或他所不認同的立場。這一決定展現他始終如一的原則與對香港市場秩序的承諾，也讓 Webb-site 的精神得以延續而非被異化。\n\n2025 年 10 月，《華爾街日報》[報導](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/david-webb-hong-kong-webb-site-china-communist-party-business-034a3718)了 Webb 在為其數據庫尋找歸宿時所面臨的挑戰。他首先接觸的是香港大學，校內教授支持成立一個非政治性的「Webb 公共透明中心」來託管和擴展該數據庫。Webb 和其他捐助者準備全額資助該計劃。然而，在 2020 年 9 月向高層管理人員提交正式提案後，大學拒絕了這一提議。時任大學新聞及傳媒研究中心主任 Keith Richburg 推測，被拒絕的原因是校方認為此事「會帶來麻煩」——這很可能與 2020 年《國安法》的實施，以及維護這類涉及香港及內地企業關係的透明數據庫所帶來的政治敏感性有關。\n\n2026 年 1 月 13 日，David Webb 因轉移性前列腺癌在香港安詳離世，享年 60 歲。他身後留下妻子與兩名子女。\n\n![David Webb](/assets/webb_afp.webp)\nPhoto: Tommy Wang/AFP\n\n## Archives\n- [Owner's Archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13mzAvvufXC3QmH8OvMVx2juUi7qdnVLL)\n- [Database Archive](https://webbsite.0xmd.com/dbpub/)\n- [ReplayWeb](https://replayweb.page/?source=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fweb-archive-storage-sage-striker-294302%2Farchives%2Fddb492c7.wacz#view=pages&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwebb-site.com%2F&ts=20250801213022)\n- [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://webb-site.com/)\n\n","n":0.047}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Wall-Fare|石牆花","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n石牆花（英語：WALL-FARE）是已解散的香港囚權支援組織，由前立法會議員邵家臻於2020年12月14日創立，旨在為所有因社會運動被捕的人士或有關人士提供各種支援，同時為在囚人士與公眾提供筆友配對計劃。除支援在囚人士外，組織亦關注在囚人士待遇問題和爭取獄政改革，例如揭發懲教署職員把囚友的「私飯」弄得橫七豎八，以及要求署方正視和改善監獄酷熱問題。但是，石牆花的連串舉動引來政府官員和建制派政治組織的批評。2021年9月7日，時任保安局局長鄧炳強不點名批評石牆花在監房「製造特權」，從而協助部分還柙人士在監獄內建立勢力並危害國家安全。同月14日，創辦人邵家臻宣佈組織即日解散並停止服務。(URL: https://wallfarehk.com/)\n\nWall-Fare was founded by former pro-democracy lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun on 14 December 2020; it provided support for detained pro-democracy activists by raising funds to provide daily necessities and providing emotional support through a coordinated a letter-writing scheme.

2026**\n\nFor Hong Kong journalists, this week's sentencing of pro-democracy newspaper boss Jimmy Lai cements a climate of fear and self-censorship in the years since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law.\n\n\"There will not be another Apple Daily, nobody dares to copy what it did,\" journalist and former press union chief Ronson Chan said of Lai's defunct tabloid, which exposed government scandals and ran scathing political commentary.\n\nOn Monday, a court handed the 78-year-old tycoon a 20-year prison term and issued sentences against six other former Apple Daily executives, all convicted under the national security law imposed in 2020 after huge pro-democracy protests.\n\nLai's punishment has been condemned by countries such as the United States and Britain, and rights groups have called it a de facto death sentence and a reflection of Hong Kong's dwindling press freedoms.\n\nJournalists in the Chinese finance hub told AFP they were already operating within political \"red lines\" since the demise of outlets like Apple Daily.\n\nJust a day after Lai's sentencing, China published a white paper that described safeguarding national security as a \"long-term and enduring task\" for Hong Kong — seen by some as a sign of Beijing doubling down.\n\nSelina Cheng, chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, told AFP that media bosses \"increasingly see themselves as an extension of the government propaganda arm\" and fear embarrassing those in power.\n\n\"The biggest impact is really the pervasiveness of self-censorship and the sense that if you write the wrong thing… that might land you in jail,\" Cheng said.\n\n#### 'Hard to accept'\n\nWhile much international attention centred on Lai, some local journalists said they were also shocked by the fates of the six former executives sentenced as co-conspirators.\n\nThey received jail terms ranging from six years and nine months to 10 years.\n\nTheir arrests as well as asset freezes and newsroom raids were the final nails in the coffin for Apple Daily, which closed its doors in June 2021.\n\nWhen Chan, the former press union chief, heard that Fung Wai-kong, the managing director of the publication's English edition, \"got 10 years, my jaw dropped\", he said.\n\n\"It was hard to accept.\"\n\nChan, who knew the defendants professionally, said some of them got their start as beat reporters and developed strong reputations.\n\n\"They made contributions to society and to the industry, but that didn't count,\" he said.\n\nIn late 2021, prominent online outlet Stand News also shut down, and its former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen eventually received a 21-month jail sentence for sedition.\n\nThe maximum penalty for sedition, which began as a colonial-era offence, was increased by a 2024 law from three to seven years in prison.\n\nIn both Apple Daily and Stand News trials, prosecutors cited articles — including opinion pieces — as evidence of journalists bringing others \"into hatred, contempt or disaffection\" of the authorities.\n\n\"These two cases cited articles that, before the national security law, would be considered ordinary,\" said a veteran journalist, who requested anonymity to speak freely on the sensitive subject.\n\n\"Even today, I think the media and even legal professionals still cannot say clearly how these articles crossed the line,\" the journalist added.\n\n#### 'Coercion'\n\nThat uncertainty was reflected in Hong Kong media's recent coverage of the purge at the top of China's People Liberation Army, according to Chan.\n\n\"There was no analysis, follow-up, background\" normally warranted for such a story, he said.\n\nMultiple interviewees told AFP that, compared to the early years of the national security law, Hong Kong authorities have made fewer high-profile moves against journalists in recent months.\n\nThe city's press still retains a much larger degree of freedom compared to their counterparts in mainland China.\n\nSome small-scale, independent news sites founded in the past five years have built audiences via a crowdfunding model, though they still face political and financial pressures.\n\nCheng, the press association chief, said these outlets are in a \"precarious\" spot, with some of them struggling with day-to-day issues such as accessing government events.\n\nIn December, China's national security arm in Hong Kong summoned foreign media representatives to a meeting, where an official condemned \"distorted\" news reporting of a deadly housing estate fire.\n\nIt was the first known meeting of its kind in Hong Kong.\n\n\"There are no signs for us to be optimistic that the era of national security law crackdown will (be reversed),\" Cheng said.\n\n\"It won't be surprising to me if more small media close because of coercion or because of threats.\"\n\n---\n\n### Hong Kong's once-vibrant press stays silent or celebrates Jimmy Lai's 20-year jail sentence\n\n**Amy Hawkins · The Guardian · Feb 10, 2026**\n\nHong Kong's once-vibrant media outlets have responded with silence or celebration to the 20-year jail sentence handed down to Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy media tycoon and critic of the Chinese Communist party.\n\nLai, 78, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison after being convicted of sedition and colluding with foreign forces under Hong Kong's national security law. The charges were widely seen as being politically motivated and designed to silence one of Hong Kong's most influential pro-democracy campaigners.\n\nThe US, the UK, the EU and the UN have condemned the heavy sentence handed down to Lai, a British citizen, and called for his release. Lai's sentence is the harshest meted out under the national security law and is longer than the punishments given to mainland China's most well-known dissidents.\n\n#### Press associations silent\n\nHong Kong's press associations, once the voices of media freedom in the city, reacted with silence, underscoring the narrowing space for commentary that could be seen as critical of the authorities.\n\nSelina Cheng, the chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), said: \"I'm not free to speak my mind on the Apple Daily sentencing.\"\n\nThe HKJA has been attacked before by the Hong Kong government for \"whitewashing\" Lai, and the association and Cheng personally have also been targeted by Chinese state media.\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong (FCC) said it had no comment about the heavy sentence given to one of Hong Kong's most influential media figures.\n\nMike Bird, a journalist for The Economist, wrote on X: \"I am so glad in retrospect that I never joined the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club, an organisation that has repeatedly disgraced itself over the past half a decade in exchange for a cheap bar.\"\n\nAn analysis by Hong Kong Free Press showed that the number of statements issued by the FCC in support of press freedom has declined dramatically since the imposition of the national security law.\n\nHong Kong's three other press associations—the Beijing-backed Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, the Hong Kong News Executives Association and the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association—also did not publish statements about Lai's sentence.\n\nRonson Chan, a former chair of the HKJA, said: \"It's abnormal for these five associations [to have] no response to Jimmy Lai's case, whether they support or regret the sentencing.\" Chan said it was a \"manipulation by the authority\" to \"disconnect the sentencing\" from press freedom issues.\n\n#### Local media celebrates\n\nHong Kong's local media outlets, however, generally celebrated the sentence given to Lai and his co-defendants.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba, published an editorial arguing that Lai's case shows that the rule of law remains \"robust\" in Hong Kong and that the sentence reflects \"the gravity of his crimes\".\n\nHK01, a pro-Beijing outlet, also praised the sentencing and said that it \"marks the end of that politically chaotic period\".\n\nTa Kung Pao, a state-owned newspaper, said: \"The anti-China and pro-chaos forces represented by Jimmy Lai have been forever nailed to the pillar of historical shame.\"\n\n#### Press freedom groups respond\n\nAleksandra Bielakowska, advocacy manager for Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said: \"Since the enactment of the national security law, media organisations and journalists in Hong Kong have faced unprecedented pressure from the authorities. In addition to judicial harassment, they are subjected to surveillance, threats, doxing, and online abuse, while foreign reporters are increasingly denied entry… Hong Kong no longer provides space for critical voices.\"\n\nBeh Lih Yi, the Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: \"We need to be clear-eyed: it is the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities that have created a repressive climate of fear. Five years since the Beijing-imposed national security law, Hong Kong's once-vibrant free press is a ghost of its former self.\"\n\nHong Kong has plummeted down RSF's press freedom index in recent years, now ranking 140th out of 180 territories surveyed.\n\n#### Beijing white paper\n\nMeanwhile, China's State Council published a white paper on Tuesday titled: \"Hong Kong: Safeguarding China's National Security Under the Framework of One Country, Two Systems.\"\n\nThe policy document detailed the \"unrelenting fight\" for national security in Hong Kong and underscored the authority of the central government in Beijing.\n\nThe paper said that Beijing's rule in Hong Kong \"serves China's fundamental interests, benefits the residents of Hong Kong, and meets the interests of external investors\".\n\n---\n\n## International Response & Analysis\n\n### Jimmy Lai Sentenced to 20 Years: Does China not care about international pressure?\n\n**Yan Liang · Radio Canada International · Feb 13, 2026**\n\nOn Monday (February 9), a Hong Kong court sentenced Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and endangering national security, the longest sentence since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law.\n\nEight other editors and reporters in the same case were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 6 to 10 years, sending a chilling message and drawing attention and criticism from the international community and human rights groups.\n\nAfter the sentence was announced, Jimmy Lai's son, Sebastien Lai, told reporters: \"They can imprison my father's body, but they cannot imprison his spirit.\"\n\n#### Canadian Response\n\nCheuk Kwan, co-chairman of the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC), told Radio Canada International that the sentence was expected, but still tragic.\n\n> \"For a 78-year-old, this is tantamount to life imprisonment. Must he really die for Hong Kong democracy, becoming a martyr? What could have a greater impact? The Chinese government should consider this.\"\n\nVina Nadjibulla, Vice-President of Research & Strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, expressed deep disappointment:\n\n> \"Jimmy Lai's sentence underscores the extent to which Hong Kong's judicial system has been fully subsumed into Beijing's broader political and security framework.\"\n\nIn Canada, several Hong Kong human rights organizations issued a joint statement urging the Canadian government to join the G7 in taking immediate action to publicly condemn, diplomatically pressure, grant Jimmy Lai honorary citizenship, and reassess trade and political ties with China.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand expressed disappointment with the verdict and called for Lai's release on humanitarian grounds.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Canada issued a remark stating that Jimmy Lai \"seriously endangered national security and hurt Hong Kong's prosperity and stability\" and that China \"firmly opposes the Canadian side's irresponsible remarks\" and urged Canada \"not to interfere in Hong Kong's judicial affairs and China's internal affairs in any form.\"\n\nAndy Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong-Canada Link, told RCI that the Jimmy Lai case is clearly not a priority for Western countries' diplomacy, as they only want to reach a trade agreement with China or reduce their dependence on the United States. He noted that the Canadian Foreign Minister's message did not even use the word \"condemnation,\" only \"disappointment.\"\n\n#### China: No Longer Indifferent to International Pressure?\n\nWorld leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and US President Donald Trump, have all mentioned the Jimmy Lai case to Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, Monday's verdict shows that China has no intention of compromising with international pressure.\n\nChinese human rights lawyer and dissident Teng Biao analyzed that China only released dissidents Wei Jingsheng (1997) and Wang Dan (1998) through negotiation on medical parole during the Clinton era. This was because China was eager to escape international condemnation and isolation following the Tiananmen Square crackdown and desperate to rejoin the international system. Releasing political prisoners was used as a diplomatic bargaining chip.\n\nHowever, the situation changed. China joined the WTO in 2001, and its economy developed rapidly. Under Xi Jinping, large-scale repression of civil society began. At the same time, the West's dependence on the Chinese economy increased significantly.\n\n> \"The power balance between China and democratic countries has undergone a significant shift. The Chinese government felt it unnecessary to use the release of important political prisoners as a bargaining chip with the West. China also became increasingly indifferent to international pressure, even completely ignoring it.\" — Teng Biao\n\nFor example, Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, never left prison until his death.\n\nCurrently, prominent Chinese dissidents still imprisoned include: Qi Huang (human rights activist), Zhan Zhang (COVID-19 whistleblower reporter), Zhiyong Xu and Jiaxi Ding (New Citizens Movement), Uyghur scholar Ilham Tohti, and Joshua Wong, Hang-tung Chow, and Cheuk-yan Lee in Hong Kong.\n\nTeng Biao notes that the effectiveness of international pressure depends on the willingness of the international community to sacrifice economic interests for human rights. However, the situation is unique now, as the US administration is continuously imposing economic pressures on Canada and European countries, forcing these democratic allies to move closer to China.\n\n#### The Path Forward\n\nFollowing his visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated: \"We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be,\" emphasizing the importance of dealing with countries with differing ideologies.\n\nCheuk Kwan, who has been promoting human rights in China since 1989, says he will continue to speak out. He believes that in the post-Trump era, democratic countries need to unite and uphold human rights values and moral courage.\n\nVina Nadjibulla, who was key in the rescue of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in the Meng Wanzhou case, believes that sustained public pressure on China is unlikely, on its own, to produce results. Beijing has shown it is willing to absorb reputational costs when framing cases as matters of national security.\n\nHowever, she argues this does not mean the outside world has no leverage:\n\n> \"Calls for Mr. Lai's release on humanitarian grounds remain the most credible and potentially effective avenue... This issue must be raised directly and consistently at the highest levels; low-key but persistent diplomatic efforts are essential in such cases. Under a system like China, such decisions are ultimately political, not judicial.\"\n\nTeng Biao concludes:\n\n> \"Perhaps no Chinese political prisoner has yet become a priority in the diplomacy of a democratic country. However, public condemnation and private mediation in democratic countries, along with sustained pressure, are important. Perhaps when the pressure reaches a certain level and the opportunity arises, the CCP will compromise. But these are difficult to predict.\"\n\n---\n\n### IBA: Conviction a symbol of the 'crushing' of democracy\n\n**Rebecca Root · International Bar Association · Jan 22, 2026**\n\nThe IBA's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) called the trial \"politically motivated\" with the purpose to \"destroy the most influential pro-democracy voice in Hong Kong under a veneer of legality.\"\n\nKey assessments from legal experts:\n\n- **Baroness Helena Kennedy KC** (IBAHRI Director): \"Lai has now become a great totem of the crushing of democracy and the rule of law\" in Hong Kong. The case \"should send a shiver down the backs of those who are doing business with Hong Kong because this is not a place that is going to necessarily be protecting your business interests.\"\n\n- **Angela Flannery** (IBA Communications Law Committee): Anticipates that many more individuals without Lai's reputation will now be prosecuted under the NSL.\n\n- **Denny Roy** (East-West Center): \"The verdict confirms that politically, Hong Kong is no longer distinguishable from China... it's a blow to hopes of democracy catching on in mainland China.\" The conviction \"underscores the Xi-era CCP's paranoia over the subversive power of Western liberal ideas. Under these circumstances, China can do business with the West but cannot be friends with the West.\"\n\n- **Yao-Tai Li** (UNSW Sydney): The case has damaged public trust in the rule of law. \"You can see the death of one country, two systems. I think it will gradually shift to one country, one system.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Bar Association defended judicial independence, stating the judiciary operates \"independently, apolitically and will not be affected by any external influence.\"\n\nChinese authorities criticized Western \"smear\" attempts: \"Their threats of sanctions are doomed to be futile.\"\n\n---\n\n## Related\n\n- [[sites.appledaily]] — Apple Daily main page\n- [[sites.standnews]] — Stand News, another outlet shut down under NSL\n- [[sites.hkja]] — Hong Kong Journalists Association\n\n## Sources\n\n- [HKFP: Hong Kong journalists face 'precarious' future after Jimmy Lai jailed](https://hongkongfp.com/2026/02/10/hong-kong-journalists-face-precarious-future-after-jimmy-lai-jailed/)\n- [The Guardian: Hong Kong's once-vibrant press stays silent or celebrates Jimmy Lai's 20-year jail sentence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/10/jimmy-lai-jail-sentence-hong-kong-press)\n- [RCI: Jimmy Lai Sentenced to 20 Years: Does China not care about international pressure?](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2228798/jimmy-lai-sentenced-to-20-years-does-china-not-care-about-international-pressure)\n- [IBA: Jimmy Lai conviction a symbol of the 'crushing' of democracy](https://www.ibanet.org/Jimmy-Lai-conviction-a-symbol-of-the-crushing-of-democracy)\n","n":0.018}}},{"i":47,"$":{"0":{"v":"How To Archive and Replay","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\n## Archive single pages\n\n- Internet Archive (https://archive.org/web/)\n    - We strongly suggest your installing [the Internet Archive plugin for browsers](https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback-machine-webextension) to save any web pages handily. \n- Webrecorder Archive (https://webrecorder.net/tools#archivewebpage)\n\n## Archive the whole site\n\nIf you are a developer, you can run up this docker container(https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) to save a web site as a whole.

Government has conducted a preference survey but has yet to unveil concrete plans; rental grants offered for short-term housing. Some residents in ~100 sq ft transitional units; officials estimate rebuilding on the fire site will take ~10 years. John Lee says the city is \"working hard\" on resettlement and that a significant proportion of homeowners have indicated willingness to sell ownership rights to the government; calls it \"no easy time\" for Wang Fuk Court families. Disaster expert Jack Rozdilsky (York University, Canada) notes that concrete mental health and trauma coping plans will be key to successful resettlement and that rebuilding a community is much harder than rebuilding living spaces ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).\n- **2026-02-20** Government set to announce long-term rehousing plan; Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun to hold a press conference on Feb 21. The government has ruled out rebuilding the seven heavily damaged blocks, citing structural issues, a ~10-year timeline, and the burden on elderly residents. Acquisition prices expected at ~HK$8,000/sq ft for unsubsidized flats and over HK$10,000/sq ft for subsidized (with land premium), above earlier surveyor estimates of HK$6,000–8,000 based on pre-fire transactions. The Support Fund has ~HK$30b remaining but full acquisition could require an additional HK$20b+ from public funds. If owners agree to a unified sale, insurance claim rights transfer to the government, removing complex processes for residents. Wang Chi House, unaffected by the fire, is excluded from the acquisition proposal. Rehousing options: Shing Chi Court (Kowloon Bay, from Sep 2026), Chung Nga Road West and Kwong Fuk Park in Tai Po (2029, 2033), and new HOS flats including Kam Tin Wui Hei Court (late Aug 2027). A flat-for-flat swap option allows exchange for a comparable HOS flat without extra payment ([The Standard](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/hong-kong-news/article/324902/) [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3344134/tai-po-fire-owners-receive-buy-back-offer-about-hk10000-sq-ft)).\n- **2026-02-21** Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong unveils the long-term resettlement plan: buyback at HK$8,000/sq ft (without land premium) or HK$10,500/sq ft (with land premium); flat-for-flat exchanges available from 10 designated HOS/Housing Society projects; redevelopment ruled out (9–10 year timeline). Government estimates HK$6.8b total cost, of which HK$4b from public funds. Former HKIS president Vincent Ho Kui-yip calls the price \"generous,\" noting it exceeds recent HOS transactions in the district; Chung Nga Road West project priced ~HK$7,000/sq ft with room to spare. However, some residents disappointed: former resident surnamed Ho (34-year resident) says many angered by proposal, calls for transparency on survey results (cited as 74% would consider acquisition, only 9% insist on redevelopment only). \"We want to go back because this is our home, it's not just about money.\" Hundreds had signed a petition for redevelopment. Lawyer Doreen Kong says government could consider compulsory acquisition legislation if a minority refuses to sell; notes no existing law covers the situation and any forced mechanism would require a bill ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3344228/wang-fuk-court-buyback-plan-disappoints-some-residents-despite-generous-offer)).\n- **2026-02-25** In the 2026 budget speech, Financial Secretary Paul Chan confirms HK$4 billion earmarked from public funds to buy out Wang Fuk Court flat owners, with HK$2.8 billion from the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (largely donations from private entities and individuals), totaling HK$6.8 billion. Chan also announces HK$3 million to enhance the URA's Smart Tender system and subsidies for homeowners to use the platform—critics note Smart Tender could not prevent suspected collusion on the Wang Fuk Court renovation. Additionally: HK$3 billion reserved for a new Development Bureau subsidy scheme for mandatory building repair works (replacing Operation Building Bright 2.0, which stopped accepting applications Sep 2023), and HK$1 billion to extend the Lift Modernisation Subsidy Scheme ([HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2026/02/25/budget-2026-hong-kong-govt-to-earmark-hk4-billion-to-buy-out-fire-hit-wang-fuk-court-flats)).\n\n### Donations\n\n- **2025-11-29–30** Filipino domestic helper Rhodora Alcaraz, 28, who had arrived in Hong Kong just one day before the fire, is hailed as a hero for rescuing her employer's 3-month-old baby and elderly mother from their smoke-filled flat. Panicked audio messages she sent to her sister during the blaze went viral. Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (Nov 29) calls her a \"model of compassion and courage\"; Senator Imee Marcos visits her in hospital (Nov 30), posting a photo of her giving a thumbs-up and calling her a \"true modern-day hero.\" Her employer Kanon Chung confirms the baby and mother are in stable condition in ICU ([AsiaOne](https://www.asiaone.com/asia/philippines-celebrates-heroic-helper-who-survived-hong-kong-fire)).\n- **2025-12-01** Donations reach HK$900m plus HK$300m government seed fund for relief;

Senior manager Chan Man-kwong (陳文光) says such nets have \"absolutely no flame retardancy.\" Lab video shows fire spreading upward with burning debris falling, net almost entirely ablaze, and debris continuing to burn after the test. The lab received over 100 inquiries since the Wang Fuk Court fire. Construction union leader Chau Si-kit (周思傑) notes the industry historically treated scaffolding as temporary equipment and undervalued fire safety, especially for major repairs.

Her mother called her after seeing thick smoke outside her door; knowing she might not survive, she asked Lo and her brother to \"live well.\" Lo rushed to her childhood home and called again minutes later—no one answered. Police confirmed her mother's death the next morning. Lo wonders if the tragedy could have been avoided had departments done better; says what bothers her most is lack of transparency on when she can see her burnt apartment and how the HK$589m relief fund will be used. Hopes the nine-month investigation will release findings. Made turnip cakes for Lunar New Year—a tradition inherited from her mother—and said in tears: \"Maybe she is still everywhere and still seeing us now.

Says the unit is not a home: \"Only a permanent residence can be a home.\" Lost his sense of security with the authorities after the blaze; says Jan 2026 government proposals on bid-rigging and fire safety still haven't addressed resettlement: \"We can only wait, being tossed around like a ball\" ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).\n- Kit Chan (陳女士) — 74-year-old resident who lived with her husband in a 460 sq ft apartment for over 40 years, raising their family in a community where neighbors helped look after each other's children.

During past Lunar New Years, the family used to visit neighbors with gifts—now those familiar faces are scattered across the city. As of Feb 2026, preparing to move into temporary homes smaller and farther from the city center; spent money to renovate them. Worries about his grandfather adjusting to a new district, away from his morning dim sum routine with friends in Tai Po. Mulling apartments in another district that could be ready sooner, prioritizing time over location given his grandfather's age: \"I fear he can't wait until we secure an apartment of about 400 square feet\" ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).\n\n## Responders\n- Ho Wai-ho (何偉豪) — Firefighter (posthumously promoted to Senior Fireman / 消防隊目), age 37, born 1987, joined Fire Services in 2016.

Construction union leader Chau Si-kit (周思傑) noted compliant nets can light but should self-extinguish quickly, and standards bar sustained flame/dripping ([InMediaHK](https://www.inmediahk.net/node/%E6%94%BF%E7%B6%93/%E3%80%90%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%E3%80%91%E3%80%8A%E7%8D%A8%E5%AA%92%E3%80%8B%E5%AF%A6%E6%B8%AC%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E6%96%B9%E5%9C%93%E5%8D%8A%E5%85%AC%E9%87%8C40%E6%A3%9A%E7%B6%B2%E7%A2%8E%E5%A1%8A-%E4%BA%94%E6%A8%A3%E6%9C%AC%E7%81%AB%E5%8B%A2%E8%BF%85%E9%80%9F%E8%94%93%E5%BB%B6)).\n- **Foam/polystyrene**: Panels sealed windows (incl. elevator lobbies), accelerating spread; melted at >500C and blew out windows (Reuters/CNN).\n- **Alarms and systems**: Post-fire inspections found alarms non-functional across all eight towers; some residents say alarms switched off during works (CNN/BBC). A Wang Cheong resident’s door-cam footage shows no alarm and smoke engulfing the corridor within 8 minutes (2:52–3:00 p.m.) before he fled by elevator ([HK01](https://www.hk01.com/%E7%AA%81%E7%99%BC/60299887/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB-9%E5%88%86%E9%90%98%E7%85%99%E6%94%BB%E5%AE%8F%E6%98%8C%E9%96%A3%E8%B5%B0%E5%BB%8A-%E4%BD%8F%E6%88%B6%E6%90%AD%F0%A8%8B%A2%E9%80%83-%E7%8C%B6%E8%B1%AB3%E5%88%86%E9%90%98%E6%88%96%E7%84%A1%E5%91%BD)).\n- **Fire spread and access**: Initial outbreak on lower exterior of Wang Cheong House; spread to Wang Tai, Wang Shing, Wang Yan; Wang Chi largely spared (Guardian/Reuters). Interior temps reported above 500C; falling scaffolding and debris hindered rescues (CNN/Reuters/AP).\n- **Resident account**: Survivor Yip Ka-kui described hearing bamboo poles “explode” and mesh igniting before foam-sealed windows trapped his wife Bai Shui Lin, who died after warning neighbors ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hong-kong-apartment-fire-survivor-wife/)).\n- **Testing/documentation gaps**: Pulse HK reports “testing reports” posted at other sites by contractor Hong Yip were merely mainland factory certificates (e.g., Binzhou center) that can be printed freely; another cited “National Labor Protection QC Center (Beijing)” was confirmed “100% fake.” HK01 similarly found multiple estates (e.g., Cheung Sha Wan Yee Kak, Chai Wan Fung Wah) displaying Binzhou/Beijing certificates for Shandong Chenxu nets; the Beijing lab said any post-2019 report using “監督” was “100% fake,” and numbers with “發證質檢(網)” were bogus ([HK01](https://www.hk01.com/01%E5%81%B5%E6%9F%A5/60299456/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB01%E8%BF%BD%E8%B9%A4-%E5%85%A9%E5%B1%8B%E8%8B%91%E7%94%A8%E5%B1%B1%E6%9D%B1%E6%A3%9A%E7%B6%B2-%E4%BA%AC%E6%AA%A2%E6%B8%AC%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83-%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A%E7%99%BE%E5%88%86%E7%99%BE%E5%81%87)). Whistleblower 潘焯鴻 (Jason Poon) stresses only HOKLAS/CNAS lab sampling after delivery counts; industry veteran says temporary materials like scaffold nets rely on self-checks by the site’s Authorized Person, creating loopholes unless consultants enforce sampling and verify suppliers/labs ([Pulse HK](https://pulsehknews.com/20251203faketestreport/)).\n- **External expert assessment**: Grenfell Tower inquiry expert José Luis Torero (UCL) says Wang Fuk Court and Grenfell shared vertical spread driven by combustible exterior materials and smoke overrunning corridors/stairs; bamboo/netting may have aided but likely not the main driver versus foam/polystyrene cladding and channel-flow between closely spaced towers. He frames the disaster as a systemic competency failure across contractors, engineers, management, and regulators, calling for a Grenfell-level technical inquiry into materials, spacing assumptions, compartmentation, and smoke-path failure ([Yahoo/信報](https://hk.finance.yahoo.com/news/%E8%8B%B1%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BD%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%A5%E5%B0%88%E5%AE%B6-%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%A4%B1%E6%95%88%E7%8C%9B%E6%96%BC%E7%81%AB-2017%E5%80%AB%E6%95%A6%E4%BD%8F%E5%AE%85%E5%A4%A7%E5%BB%88%E7%87%92%E9%80%9A%E9%A0%82-%E8%88%87%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E7%9B%B8%E4%BC%BC-184700834.html)).\n- **Policy and regulatory actions**: Mainland authorities ordered a nationwide inspection of high-rises—especially under renovation with bamboo/wood scaffolding and non-flame-retardant nets—while Hong Kong said 7 of 20 netting samples failed and signaled a gradual shift toward metal scaffolding without blaming bamboo alone ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).\n- **Market-wide testing (Dec 2025)**: Castco Testing Centre (佳力高試驗中心), a HOKLAS-accredited government-designated lab, received over 100 inquiries after the Wang Fuk Court fire and tested ~20 scaffolding net samples from contractors and netting companies this month; ~80% failed fire-retardancy standards. One sample burned for over 40 seconds—10 times the 4-second average limit required under standards. Lab video shows fire spreading upward with burning debris falling, net almost entirely ablaze, and debris continuing to burn after the test ended. Senior manager Chan Man-kwong (陳文光): \"If it burns that long, it absolutely has no flame retardancy.\" Construction union leader Chau Si-kit (周思傑) notes the industry historically treated scaffolding as temporary equipment and undervalued fire safety for major repairs ([Now News](https://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=630888)).\n- **New regulatory measures (Dec 2025)**: Authorities introduced strengthened controls: contractors must provide flame-retardancy performance certificates for scaffolding nets; incoming materials must be sampled and tested after arrival in Hong Kong; designated-lab test reports must carry digital signatures for authentication; testing turnaround is ~3 working days ([Now News](https://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=630888)).\n- **Oversight fallout**: Officials suspended 28 other renovation projects run by the same contractor while citing cost-cutting mesh swaps after a typhoon; analysts warn the safety gaps and bid-rigging risks extend across Hong Kong’s high-rise stock ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-wang-china-dissent-fire-construction-ff953aec2bc0201b0e3255805a241fc1)).\n- **Scene documentation**: On Nov 30 the Disaster Victim Identification Unit entered the towers to map interiors and recover remains; widely shared photos show flats reduced to ash with exposed rebar, blackened walls, and charred fixtures, highlighting the scale of destruction across seven of eight blocks ([The Standard](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/hong-kong-news/article/318169/)).\n\n![Burned interior at Wang Fuk Court showing collapsed plaster, ash-covered floors, and charred fixtures — DVIU survey photo.](/assets/burnt_house_hkpf.jpg)\n\n## Insurance and Liability\n- Taiping Hong Kong (insurer for Wang Fuk Court renovation and estate policies) paid a first batch of nine home-insurance claims totaling HK$5.372m on Dec 1; the estate’s property insurance carries a reported HK$20b sum insured with third-party liability cover up to HK$200m per incident, backed by reinsurance partners including Qianhai Re, China Re P&C, and Taiping Re ([Sina](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-12-02/doc-infzmppc0220721.shtml)).\n- Coverage in place includes construction all-risk, employees’ compensation, owners’ corporation third-party liability, property all-risk/public liability, and some household/helper policies; industry estimates expect payouts to approach policy limits, with reinsurers sharing the exposure (Sina).\n\n## Tender Irregularities and Oversight Gaps\n- **Industry-wide bid-rigging scope**: Since 2023, Competition Commission and ICAC crackdowns dismantled at least 4 bid-rigging syndicates involved in 70+ renovation projects worth HK$2.3 billion. In September 2025—less than three months before the fire—the Competition Commission raided 9 contractors in connection with alleged bid-rigging involving 25 projects worth HK$600 million, describing two syndicates as \"sizable\" with \"cohesive organizational structures\" that had been \"operating for some time\" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).\n- **2015 first conviction**: Hong Kong's first bid-rigging conviction saw a middleman sentenced to 35 months for conspiracy to offer bribes totaling ~HK$45 million. Judge Josiah Lam warned that lack of competition and oversight allowed contractors to \"further lower the quality of a project\" and \"maximize exorbitant profits\" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).\n- Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS): The Wang Fuk Court renovation was commissioned under the 2012 MBIS; after the 2023 tender the price jumped from an estimated HK$140m to HK$330m (RFI).\n- Budget escalation: SCMP reports internal documents showing Wang Fuk Court’s budget rising from HK$152m (Sep 2023 analysis) to HK$336m after adopting the most expensive option, including full mosaic removal/repaving and added drainage/fire upgrades; experts call the renovation sector “rotten” with bid-rigging/collusion and urge an overhaul ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3334964/whole-market-rotten-hong-kong-fire-exposes-greedy-building-renovation-business)).\n- Alleged bid-rigging and interference: Residents reported suspected triad-linked individuals blocking dissenting owners from meetings; a new owners’ corporation replaced the old one in Sep 2024 after the contract was already signed (RFI).\n- Academic/press analysis of collusion: Points Media cites a 2022 paper (Leung Tsang Tsui, Singapore Economic Review) using the now-closed FactWire database to show the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme cut owners’ bargaining power, raising renovation bids ~40% and fostering collusion; Prestige Construction & Engineering Ltd. (宏業建築工程有限公司; aka Hong Yip Construction Engineering) was among the most active firms (104 bids, with unusually high/low rankings). Article notes pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao removed a piece calling Prestige a “常勝將軍,” and quotes anonymous consultants alleging “招標妥” advisors take kickbacks, eroding oversight ([Points Media](https://points-media.com/%e9%a6%99%e6%b8%af/%e9%a6%99%e6%b8%af-%e4%b8%96%e7%b4%80%e5%a4%a7%e7%81%ab-%e5%ad%b8%e8%80%85-%e5%bc%b7%e5%88%b6%e9%a9%97%e6%a8%93-%e5%88%b6%e5%ba%a6-%e5%9c%8d%e6%a8%99-%e8%ad%b0%e5%83%b9-%e5%ae%8f%e6%a5%ad/)).\n- Property management role: Bloomberg reports ISS A/S shares fell up to 11% on Dec 2 after SCMP noted its unit EastPoint Properties acted as Wang Fuk Court property manager. ISS says it only handled administrative tendering for the Incorporated Owners via an e-tender platform, made no recommendations, and welcomes the judge-led independent committee ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/iss-shares-plunge-after-hong-kong-launches-apartment-fire-probe)).\n- URA scoring controversy: HKEJ says contractor Prestige Construction & Engineering Ltd. (宏業建築工程有限公司; aka Hong Yip Construction Engineering) received a 100/100 “project management” rating under the Urban Renewal Authority’s Building Rehab Company Registration Scheme. URA admits the display could mislead the public into thinking it is an overall contractor grade rather than a system-integrity check; the scheme also did not require declarations of site-safety convictions. URA plans to revise the audit scope/methods/display and to review its “招標妥” tender-support service to ensure consultant technical scoring is based on verifiable data and to reduce corruption/bid-rigging risks ([HKEJ](https://www.hkej.com/instantnews/article?id=4264192)).\n- ICAC complaints and scope concerns: Residents told i-Cable they tipped ICAC before the contract was signed but were asked for evidence and saw no probe until after the fire; a July 2024 owners’ briefing featured a lawyer warning owners they would bear legal liability if a leadership change voided the contract, discouraging a halt. The contractor reportedly runs repairs at 11 estates; other estates paused work and removed scaffold netting after the blaze while consultants demanded proof of flame-retardant materials and stricter site no-smoking enforcement ([i-Cable](https://www.i-cable.com/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E8%B3%87%E8%A8%8A/415811/%E4%B8%80%E7%B7%9A%E6%90%9C%E6%9F%A5-%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB%E8%83%8C%E5%BE%8C-%E4%B8%89%E7%96%91%E9%BB%9E%E6%83%B9%E9%97%9C%E6%B3%A8-%E5%B1%85%E6%B0%91)).\n- Complaints ignored: During works, residents complained to multiple departments about flammable mesh and foam sealing windows but “got nowhere”; disqualified pro-democracy district councillors who tried to assist were expelled for lacking official status (RFI).\n- Historical context: FactWire's 2017 database (3,000 bids across 220 estates) highlighted systemic bid-rigging patterns in building maintenance—low consultant fees, market concentration, irregular pricing—mirroring current suspicions [FactWire](https://www.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/01/AP692d69ede4b0c32d4f618e05.html).\n- Prior enforcement: In April and August 2024, ICAC and the Competition Commission conducted two joint operations against syndicates suspected of graft and bid-rigging, arresting 25 people ([HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2026/01/02/anti-graft-agency-arrests-21-over-housing-estate-renovation-projects-in-kwun-tong/)).\n- **Parallel cases post-fire**:\n  - **Sui Wo Court** (near Wang Fuk Court): Residents gathered every weekend since early 2025 to voice concerns about a HK$371 million maintenance project that was supposed to wrap up in December but has not been completed; one resident reported receiving an anonymous thank-you card for allowing someone to vote on her behalf when she had voted in person. Homeowners committee chairwoman Pauline Leung Po-ling denied wrongdoing; ICAC said no case to answer ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).\n  - **Fairview Park** (Yuen Long): Homeowners campaigned against a HK$500 million plan to replace underground water pipes. In September 2025 the property management company refused to provide a detailed budget breakdown, tender evaluation criteria, or contractor identity before contract signing; after the Wang Fuk Court fire the company agreed to residents' demands and halted the project. At least 30 residents marched to ICAC to demand an investigation ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).\n- Post-fire Kwun Tong sweep (Jan 2, 2026): ICAC arrested 21 people (15 men, 6 women, aged 30–81) over renovation bid-rigging at two Kwun Tong estates, neutralizing a \"building maintenance corruption syndicate controlled by individuals with triad background.\" Targets included intermediaries, engineering consultants, and owners' incorporation members; one HK$33m contract allegedly secured via bribes. The operation underscores systemic bid-rigging concerns amplified by the Wang Fuk Court fire ([HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2026/01/02/anti-graft-agency-arrests-21-over-housing-estate-renovation-projects-in-kwun-tong/)).\n- Anti-bid-rigging push (2016): Former ICAC investigator and Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, long active on bid-rigging cases, stood with the Anti-Bid-Rigging Alliance to warn government amendment proposals lacked deterrence and called for stronger criminal sanctions; they cited a decade of systemic tender corruption and publicized a hotline ([HK01](https://www.hk01.com/article/21100?utm_source=01articlecopy&utm_medium=referral)). ![Lam Cheuk-ting (center right) speaking at an Anti-Bid-Rigging Alliance presser, 2016.

On Dec 17, ICAC arrested current OC chairperson Tsui Mun-kam (徐滿柑) and former chairperson Tang Kwok-kuen (鄧國權), who served five consecutive terms (2012–Sep 2024) and signed the HK$330m repair contract ([on.cc](https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20251217/bkn-20251217175140460-1217_00822_001.html)).\n- Fire-services contractor fraud (Dec 3): Police arrested six men (aged 44–55) from the fire-services contractor for alleged fraud, accusing them of falsely telling FSD they would not disable alarms during works while submitting notices citing only hydrant/hose reel shutdowns; all bailed to report in Jan 2026 ([HK01](https://global.hk01.com/%E7%AA%81%E5%8F%91/60300231/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BE-%E8%AD%A6%E6%8B%98%E6%B6%88%E9%98%B2%E8%A3%85%E7%BD%AE%E6%89%BF%E5%8A%9E%E5%95%866%E4%BA%BA-%E6%B6%89%E8%AE%B9%E7%A7%B0%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E6%97%B6%E4%B8%8D%E5%85%B3%E8%AD%A6%E9%92%9F)).\n- Materials: Police and officials allege flammable mesh/foam used; some netting initially certified compliant; ongoing verification of actual materials used on-site.\n- Non-statutory review: Chief Executive John Lee announced a judge-led committee (non-statutory), pledging administrative directives for evidence access; statutory Independent Commission of Inquiry was rejected despite civic calls (RFI). On Dec 12 he said the panel, chaired by Electoral Affairs Commission head Judge David Lok, will report within nine months and examine systemic construction risks, conflicts of interest, collusion, and bid-rigging (Reuters).\n- **First public meeting (Feb 5, 2026)**: The independent committee held its first public meeting at City Gallery in Central. Senior Counsel Victor Dawes, the committee's leading counsel, said it had received evidence from authorities including \"key information and clues\" and already has a good understanding of the fire's cause and systemic issues. Residents can apply to give evidence by Feb 12; approved applicants must file submissions by Feb 23. Next hearing scheduled for Mar 19 when evidence examination begins. Judge Lok noted the committee could recommend conversion to a statutory Commission of Inquiry if powers prove insufficient, but said this would take \"years\" versus the expedited nine-month timeline. Attendees included lawyers for the committee, government, URA, and ISS Eastpoint Properties Ltd.; representatives of the Competition Commission, ICAC, and DOJ; and counsel for Wong Hap-yin, a director of Will Power Architects Company Limited (the consultancy overseeing repair works)—the only arrested person to attend. Residents called for accountability, with one surnamed Chan saying: \"I hope the investigation will clearly determine the insufficiencies of each government department so that we won't ever see this happen again\" ([HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2026/02/05/residents-of-fire-hit-estate-urge-accountability-compensation-as-review-committee-holds-first-public-meeting/)).\n- Contractor fallout: Hung Ngai Architects Ltd.

The books use allegory to depict Hong Kong's political struggles, with sheep representing Hong Kong residents and wolves representing mainland Chinese authorities.\n\n**[📚 View All Three Books in Interactive Viewer](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/viewer.html)**\n\n## Legal Case and Convictions\n\nIn July 2021, five members of the speech therapists' union were arrested and charged with \"conspiracy to publish seditious publications\" under a colonial-era sedition law:\n\n- **Lorie Lai** (黎雯齡) - Union chairperson\n- **Melody Yeung** (楊逸意) - External vice-chairperson\n- **Sidney Ng** (吳梓瑋)\n- **Samuel Chan** (陳源森)\n- **Marco Fong** (方梓皓)\n\nAll five, aged between 25 and 28 at the time of arrest, were denied bail and held in pre-trial detention for over 13 months.\n\n**September 2022 Conviction:** In September 2022, all five defendants were found guilty and sentenced to 19 months in prison. The judge ruled the books were an \"exercise in brainwashing\" meant to incite hatred toward the government. The five were released shortly after sentencing, with credit for time served during pre-trial detention.\n\n**Defiant Statements:** During sentencing, some maintained their stance:\n- Melody Yeung told the court she had \"no regrets\" and only wished she had \"published more picture books\" before her arrest\n- Lorie Lai attempted to argue that her only \"crime\" was trying to tell a story from the people's perspective\n\n**Aftermath:**\n- The General Union of Hong Kong Speech Therapists was de-registered and disbanded by the government\n- In late 2024, the High Court ordered the seizure of the defunct union's remaining assets (approximately HK$116,000) on national security grounds\n- Since 2023, individuals in Hong Kong have been arrested and sentenced to prison merely for importing or possessing copies of these books, which are now classified as \"seditious publications\"\n\n## The Three Books \n\nThe first book, titled \"Guardians of Sheep Village\" (羊村守衛者), explains the 2019 pro-democracy protests that swept through Hong Kong.\n\n\"Janitors of Sheep Village\" (羊村清道夫), the second book, sees cleaners in the village go on strike to force out wolves who leave litter everywhere. The book's introduction explains it is a reference to Hong Kong medical workers striking in February 2020 in a bid to force the government to close the border with mainland China at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe final book in the trilogy -- \"The 12 Braves of Sheep Village\" (羊村十二勇士) -- is about a group of sheep who flee their village by boat because of the wolves. It references the \"Hong Kong 12,\" a group of activists captured by the Chinese coastguard while attempting to flee to Taiwan.\n\n## 中文概述\n\n羊村繪本共三冊，分別為《羊村守衛者》、《羊村十二勇士》和《羊村清道夫》。三本繪本分別描寫二零一九年反修例風波、十二港人案及2020年2月3-7日香港醫護罷工行動。警方批評繪本合理化暴力事件及違法行為荼毒下一代。支持者認為繪本只是反映事實，並不構成煽動暴力或社會仇恨。此外，外界亦擔心是次事件會削弱香港的言論自由，令港人未來難以安心創作藝術作品、政治漫畫及評論政治。\n\n2021年7月，工會5名成員因涉嫌串謀刊印、發佈、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物罪被捕，包括主席黎雯齡及外務副主席楊逸意，以及工會其餘3名理事會成員吳梓瑋、陳源森、方梓皓。五人全部不獲保釋，須還柙候審超過13個月。工會的資金遭到凍結。工會及工會成員的電腦、傳單、電話等亦被扣留。\n\n2022年9月，五人全部被裁定罪名成立，被判入獄19個月。法官裁定繪本是「洗腦」企圖煽動對政府的仇恨。五人於判刑後不久獲釋，因已於審前羈留期間服刑超過13個月。\n\n判刑期間，楊逸意在法庭上表示她「沒有後悔」，只希望在被捕前「出版更多繪本」。黎雯齡則試圖辯稱她唯一的「罪行」就是試圖從人民的角度講述故事。\n\n其後，香港言語治療師總工會被政府撤銷註冊並解散。2024年末，高等法院基於國家安全理由下令沒收已解散工會的剩餘資產約11.6萬港元。自2023年起，有香港市民僅因進口或管有這些繪本副本而被捕及判監，該等繪本現已被列為「煽動刊物」。\n\n## 詳細內容\n\n### 《羊村守衛者》\n2020年6月，香港言語治療師總工會出版一本名為《羊村守衛者》的繪本，以2019年發生的反修例事件作背景，將中共政權描繪成狼，香港人則描繪成羊。故事內容講述有兩條村落，一條村是住了善良的羊，另一條村是住了邪惡的狼。有一天，守護羊的牧羊人突然離開了，狼村落便派了大灰狼去帶領羊群，並頒佈「狼羊規矩」，規定狼群可隨意吃掉羊，結果羊起來反抗。繪本裏列有反修例事件的時序表，以及相應故事的頁數。故事最後向讀者發問：「如果你是羊，會否勇敢繼續守衛家園？」\n\n<iframe src=\"/assets/sheep-village-viewer/guardians.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\"></iframe>\n\n**[📖 Open in Full Screen](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/guardians.html)** | **[📥 Download PDF](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/guardians.pdf)**\n\n\n### 《羊村十二勇士》\n\n2020年9月，香港言語治療師總工會再次出版另一本「羊村系列」繪本，名為《羊村十二勇士》，故事繼承上一本《羊村守衛者》的內容，都是講述狼欺壓羊，而《羊村十二勇士》就以2020年8月時發生的12名逃犯潛逃台灣的案件作背景。\n\n在《羊村十二勇士》中，羊群為了對抗狼群而變得團結和英勇，狼群首領大灰狼擔心未來不能再欺負羊群，便下令要殺死羊群中最勇敢的12隻羊。12隻羊便嘗試逃走結果失敗，被狼抓回狼村。然而，故事裏該12隻羊的名字都和偷越邊境案的12名逃犯相同，有聲音批評此舉明顯是將12名逃犯英雄化，將其描述是守衛香港、卻被迫害以致要離開香港的勇士。故事最後向讀者發問：「如果你是羊，會否用盡辦法拯救十二位勇士？」\n\n<iframe src=\"/assets/sheep-village-viewer/heroes.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\"></iframe>\n\n**[📖 Open in Full Screen](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/heroes.html)** | **[📥 Download PDF](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/heroes.pdf)**\n\n### 《羊村清道夫》\n2021年3月，香港言語治療師總工會出版第三本名為《羊村清道夫》的繪本，繼續將內地人描繪為狼，香港人則是羊，並以2020年2月醫護於新冠疫情期間罷工事件作背景。故事描述狼在羊村開了一個「窿」，骯髒的狼不斷進進出出，狼不單隨地拋垃圾，更四處吐痰，令周圍環境變得污穢，而羊就罷工要求封關，禁止狼再進入羊村。\n\n<iframe src=\"/assets/sheep-village-viewer/dustman.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\"></iframe>\n\n**[📖 Open in Full Screen](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/dustman.html)** | **[📥 Download PDF](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/dustman.pdf)**\n\n\n## Archives\n\n### Local Preservation\n- [The Guardians of Sheep Village (羊村守衛者)](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/guardians.pdf)\n- [The 12 Heroes of Sheep Village (羊村十二勇士)](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/heroes.pdf)\n- [Dustman of Sheep Village (羊村清道夫)](/assets/sheep-village-viewer/dustman.pdf)\n\n### External Archives\n- [Sheep Village Series (1-3) on IPFS/Web3](https://bafybeicntq4lzhytql7ey2y2tc4uu6ptyh7oy56bxpxcvxqkdh62uegip4.ipfs.dweb.link/fixtures)\n- [Original GCS Archive - The Guardians](https://storage.googleapis.com/web-archive-storage-sage-striker-294302/archives/%E7%BE%8A%E6%9D%91%E5%AE%88%E8%A1%9B%E8%80%85.pdf)\n- [Original GCS Archive - The 12 Heroes](https://storage.googleapis.com/web-archive-storage-sage-striker-294302/archives/%E7%BE%8A%E6%9D%91%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%8C%E5%8B%87%E5%A3%AB.pdf)\n- [Original GCS Archive - Dustman](https://storage.googleapis.com/web-archive-storage-sage-striker-294302/archives/%E7%BE%8A%E6%9D%91%E6%B8%85%E9%81%93%E5%A4%AB.pdf)","n":0.043}}},{"i":57,"$":{"0":{"v":"Glory To Hong Kong(Song)","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n> \"Glory to Hong Kong\" is a march that was composed and written by a musician under the pseudonym \"Thomas dgx yhl\", with the contribution of a group of Hongkonger netizens from the online forum LIHKG during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests.

Launched on August 4, 2021, the museum was created in response to increasing political repression in Hong Kong, aiming to safeguard historical artifacts, archives, images, and oral histories related to June 4th. After the passing of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the museum became an independent overseas project, continuing its mission to connect and preserve the history of the Chinese democracy movement for future generations.\n\n2021年8月4日零點，眾籌一週年之際，「六四記憶‧人權博物館」開幕。\n\n 「六四記憶‧人權博物館」\n1989年6月4日，軍隊進入北京城進行武力鎮壓，維時近兩個月的天安門民主運動戛然而止。而後，六四記憶不斷被官方抹除。此後30年裡，身為這段歷史見證者的香港人，用燃起30年的燭光、和對中國民主運動的持續支援，實踐承諾，守護記憶，捍衛人權，亦持續爭取香港民主。\n\n2020年，隨著港版國安法急速通過，悼念六四的燭光集會首次被定性為非法集結。當晚，香港支聯會（香港市民支援愛國民主運動聯合會）啟動眾籌，呼籲在法律危機下，尋求永久空間保存歷史記憶：在網絡建立「六四記憶．人權博物館」，保存在香港已傳承了30年的文物、檔案、影像、口述歷史等；並在未來連結世界各地關於六四的檔案庫。2020年6月至8月，博物館計劃收到1,186位捐款者的慷慨相助，募得款項共計港幣1,675,032元，全數投入博物館的籌建及運作。\n\n搶救記憶，重建論述，將1989年中國民運的歷史與香港、中國大陸及世界的抗爭歷史相連，這是「六四記憶．人權博物館」的使命。博物館邀請到親歷八九一代的中國記者、作家長平先生擔任總策展人，並在全球建立策展、檔案及技術團隊，力圖保持史料完整性、呈現真實感、並能夠與當代對話。\n\n2021年8月4日零點，眾籌一週年之際，「六四記憶‧人權博物館」如約啓幕。\n\n博物館開幕之際，由於香港政治打壓愈演愈烈，支聯會已於7月10日作出策略性人手調整，常委人數僅餘7人，包括現時正失去人身自由的主席李卓人及副主席鄒幸彤，並遣散所有職員。有鑑於此，「六四記憶·人權博物館」即日起亦脫離支聯會，由海外策展團隊負責獨立運作。\n\n首次開幕，展出六個展館：時間館、空間館、人物館、香港館、文藝館、媒體館。此後，博物館將持續更新，補充現有展館內容，逐步釋出更詳細的史料，翻譯多語言版本，並將不定期因應時事與紀念日主題，開設主題特展。\n\n燭光不滅，真相永存。寸心千古，莫失莫忘。\n\n學術委員會\n「六四記憶‧人權博物館」成立學術委員會，邀約對1989中國民運、中國民主化及社會運動歷史做過長期研究的專家學者加入，給博物館的長期策展、史料收集及研究，搭建可信的學術基礎。\n\n以下是第一批學術委員會名單（按首字母拼音排列）：\n\n阿古智子（AKO Tomoko） 日本東京大學\n白夏（Jean-Philippe Béja) 法國巴黎政治學院\n陳至潔 台灣國立中山大學\n林培瑞（Perry Link）美國加州大學河濱分校\n宋永毅 加州州立大學洛杉磯分校\n王超華 獨立學者\n吳國光 加拿大維多利亞大學\n吳仁華 台灣東吳大學\n博物館策展及製作團隊\n總策展人：長平\n策展編輯：DLS\n數位資料團隊：CYL、LLT、RRG、ZYC、B、Judo、T、C2H、Samuel、XQ、KW、NAIVE、CPJ、TW、LCY\n視覺設計及網站製作：Neverland Studio\n系統工程師：PL\n總監製：June\n\nURL: https://8964museum.com/ (https://www.8964museum.com/ doesn't work)\n\n## Archives\n\n- [.WaCZ as of 04-05-2022](https://bafybeiaosxoqskh4oueocv5zyv6dilabqwnidwjmsbeqrvhjvjk7mjrl54.ipfs.dweb.link/fixtures/8964museum-05_04_2022.wacz) -> [Replay)](https://replayweb.page/?source=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fweb-archive-storage-sage-striker-294302%2Farchives%2F8964museum-05_04_2022.wacz#view=pages&url=https%3A%2F%2F8964museum.com%2F&ts=20220504141122)\n- [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://8964museum.com/)","n":0.094}}},{"i":59,"$":{"0":{"v":"Background","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nSince 2020, Hong Kong has been subject to the National Security Law imposed by the central government, sparking strong backlash from both local and international communities.\n\nIn the wake of the law’s implementation, civil society in Hong Kong has suffered devastating setbacks—not only through the arrest or exile of key activists, but also through the dismantling of their projects and the loss of public information channels.\n\nThe idea for SHKO emerged from a shared concern over a series of crackdowns in Hong Kong, including the disappearance of independent media outlets and the forced shutdown of numerous non-governmental organizations. With the list of endangered projects growing rapidly, civil society has had little time or capacity to respond—particularly in preserving the legacy content and historical records, whether digital or physical, of these suppressed entities.\n\nIn response, a group of digital activists has launched a new initiative in collaboration with this project. Their mission is to build open-source tools that can preserve these clusters of historically significant content and establish a replicable model for use in similar politically sensitive environments.\n\nThe immediate goal is to collect and archive at-risk content from affected organizations, creating a publicly accessible online archive. Long-term, the project aims to ensure this content remains available for at least a decade or more, safeguarded through decentralized and crowd-supported means.\n\nUltimately, the project seeks to establish a preservation model that is open, transparent, and reusable. All tools and methodologies—excluding any private participant information—will be open-sourced, enabling others around the world to adopt and adapt the framework for their own preservation efforts.\n\n\n## references\n\n- [Free media in Hong Kong almost completely dismantled](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/free-media-in-hong-kong-almost-completely-dismantled-report?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld)\n- [Hong Kong’s Human Rights Press Awards cancelled, citing legal risks](https://hongkongfp.com/2022/04/25/breaking-hong-kongs-human-rights-press-awards-cancelled/) \n- [World Press Freedom Day: Hong Kong nosedives in press freedom ranking – below Cambodia, Somalia, Sri Lanka](https://web.archive.org/web/20220505015738/https://hongkongfp.com/2022/05/03/world-press-freedom-day-hong-kong-nosedives-in-press-freedom-ranking-below-cambodia-somalia-sri-lanka/)\n","n":0.059}}}]}
