Power for Democracy was a pro-democracy political group in Hong Kong established by a group of pro-democracy activists in 2002. It worked mainly as a mediating platform for electoral coordination between the pro-democratic parties. It also conducted academic research on issues related to the development of democracy in Hong Kong, and actively participated in and organised various social actions and public education to promote democratization and reform of Hong Kong's political system. On 27 February 2021, the organisation announced its disbandment in the wake of the National Security Law. (URL: https://www.facebook.com/PowerForDemocracy/about?ref=page_internal)
