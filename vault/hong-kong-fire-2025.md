The blaze, which began around 3 p.m. on November 26, 2025, rapidly spread across seven high-rise buildings, triggering a level 5 alarm and a massive emergency response involving more than 800 firefighters and paramedics. Many of the deceased were elderly residents trapped inside the burning structures, and authorities are still working to account for approximately 279 individuals who remain uncontactable.

Officials say the rapid spread of the fire was exacerbated by highly flammable polystyrene materials used in ongoing renovations that blocked windows and escape routes. One firefighter was among the dead, and several others were treated for heat exhaustion during the rescue effort.

In the wake of the tragedy, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an "all-out effort" to extinguish the fire and minimize casualties. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee emphasized that the immediate priority is to rescue any remaining residents trapped inside the buildings.

As investigations unfold, three men from the construction company involved in the renovations have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, with authorities citing gross negligence as a key factor in the fire's rapid escalation. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has also launched a probe, resulting in eight arrests linked to the renovation project, including project managers and subcontractors.

By December 2, police reported 15 total manslaughter arrests after discovering exterior scaffolding netting failed fire-resistance standards and was allegedly swapped to evade inspections. John Lee pledged a judge-led independent committee to review the incident but, according to government sources [Tweet](https://x.com/haileyhmt/status/1995860431177449729?s=46), ruled out a statutory Independent Commission of Inquiry, promising to personally use administrative directives so the non-statutory committee can obtain evidence quickly. Authorities continued to search for 30 unaccounted individuals and identify 29 of the dead. Public grief has been met with arrests of residents and activists calling for accountability, including reports of detentions over leaflets and petitions, with police and the security chief warning against alleged online misinformation [RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20251201-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BE%E5%BD%93%E5%B1%80%E4%B8%A5%E6%89%93%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C-%E8%99%9A%E5%81%87%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF-%E4%B8%A4%E5%A4%A9%E6%8D%95%E4%B8%89%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E6%8B%9B%E6%A0%87%E5%8F%97%E5%85%B3%E6%B3%A8-%E4%BA%B2%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A7%E5%85%9A%E6%B0%91%E5%BB%BA%E8%81%94%E6%80%A5%E5%88%87%E5%89%B2?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=threads&utm_source=shorty&utm_slink=rfi.my%2FCEOr) and officials warning about rumor-mongering [NBC/AP](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-say-netting-buildings-did-not-meet-code-rcna246719?link_source=ta_thread_link&taid=692d8cbebc95c000011633a6&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=threads.net).

Community leaders have expressed outrage over the incident, demanding accountability and a thorough investigation into the safety practices of construction companies in Hong Kong. Public anger is mounting, with protests calling for an independent investigation into the causes of the fire and the systemic issues within the construction industry. Authorities have also accused "anti-China forces" of exploiting the tragedy for political gain, further complicating the narrative surrounding the event.
