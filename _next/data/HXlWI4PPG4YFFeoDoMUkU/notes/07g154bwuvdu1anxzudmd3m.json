Founded in July 1990, it led a number of labour movements and at its peak had more than 90 affiliated unions with over 190,000 members. It had 78 affiliates by the time of its dissolution in October 2021, and was once one of the largest trade union federations in Hong Kong. The head office of the CTU was located on the 7th and 19th floors of Aeon Hong Kong, 557-559 Nathan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The former Chairman of the HKCTU is Representative Wong Nai-yuen, and Lee Cheuk-yan is the Secretary General. The four main platforms of the HKCTU are unity, dignity, justice and democracy. On 17 September 2021, Wen Wei Po reported that the executive committee of the HKCTU held a meeting on the evening of 16 September and approved the decision to initiate the dissolution process, and that a general meeting would be held on 3 October to formally endorse the dissolution. Reportedly, Mr Mong Siu-tat, who has been the General Secretary since 2012, has announced his resignation. Speaking to reporters after the meeting on 3 October 2021, HKCTU Chairman Wong Nai-yuen said the dissolution was approved by a majority of 57 votes in favour, 8 against and 2 abstentions. The 31-year old HKCTU was officially dissolved.

In response to the sweeping shutdowns caused by political changes in Hong Kong, we aim to safeguard digital heritage before it vanishes. This project is anonymous, open source, and supported by a global network of contributors.\n\nWhile most sites in our archive were forced offline due to Hong Kong’s political deterioration, it’s important to note that [[RFA Cantonese|sites.rfa_cantonese]] is the only site here closed not because of Hong Kong’s situation, but due to internal political decisions in the United States.\n\nExplore our full list of preserved sites and archives on the [Collections page](/notes/wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u/).\n\n## Goals\n- To preserve as much information as possible before its disappearance during Hong Kong's great transition\n- To illustrate a viable method that everyone can use to help preserve online heritage with no pains\n- To demonstrate global collaborations to save local digital heritages with best practices\n\n## Quick Facts\n\nWe are working on over dozens of [[websites or online causes | sites]] in Hong Kong in the past two decades which has been forced to shutdown or at the brink of disappearing.
