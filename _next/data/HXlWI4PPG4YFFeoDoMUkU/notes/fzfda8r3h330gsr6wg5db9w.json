With the list of endangered projects growing rapidly, civil society has had little time or capacity to respond—particularly in preserving the legacy content and historical records, whether digital or physical, of these suppressed entities.</p>\n<p>In response, a group of digital activists has launched a new initiative in collaboration with this project. Their mission is to build open-source tools that can preserve these clusters of historically significant content and establish a replicable model for use in similar politically sensitive environments.</p>\n<p>The immediate goal is to collect and archive at-risk content from affected organizations, creating a publicly accessible online archive. Long-term, the project aims to ensure this content remains available for at least a decade or more, safeguarded through decentralized and crowd-supported means.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the project seeks to establish a preservation model that is open, transparent, and reusable. All tools and methodologies—excluding any private participant information—will be open-sourced, enabling others around the world to adopt and adapt the framework for their own preservation efforts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#references\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>references</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/free-media-in-hong-kong-almost-completely-dismantled-report?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld\">Free media in Hong Kong almost completely dismantled</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2022/04/25/breaking-hong-kongs-human-rights-press-awards-cancelled/\">Hong Kong’s Human Rights Press Awards cancelled, citing legal risks</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220505015738/https://hongkongfp.com/2022/05/03/world-press-freedom-day-hong-kong-nosedives-in-press-freedom-ranking-below-cambodia-somalia-sri-lanka/\">World Press Freedom Day: Hong Kong nosedives in press freedom ranking – below Cambodia, Somalia, Sri Lanka</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","title":"SHKO(Save Hong Kong Online)","desc":"","updated":1754149906369,"created":1648525691085,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"b2342439d1f39036b77dfb5a9d257bac","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites.rfa_cantonese","alias":"RFA Cantonese","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":125,"offset":807},"end":{"line":7,"column":162,"offset":844},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites.rfa_cantonese"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites","alias":"websites or online causes","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":34,"offset":1448},"end":{"line":18,"column":71,"offset":1485},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"howto","alias":"contribute","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":201,"offset":1615},"end":{"line":18,"column":223,"offset":1637},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"howto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sponsorship","alias":"sponsor","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":246,"offset":1660},"end":{"line":18,"column":271,"offset":1685},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sponsorship"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites.appledaily","alias":"sites.appledaily","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":3,"offset":1736},"end":{"line":21,"column":23,"offset":1756},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites.appledaily"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites.inmediahk","alias":"sites.inmediahk","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":1771},"end":{"line":22,"column":22,"offset":1790},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites.inmediahk"}}],"anchors":{"goals":{"type":"header","text":"Goals","value":"goals","line":17,"column":0,"depth":2},"quick-facts":{"type":"header","text":"Quick Facts","value":"quick-facts","line":22,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["fzfda8r3h330gsr6wg5db9w","dr6y9n9s72kljfnr7bpwvqj","iu6nr9qel896bjhbckfl05d","vzihkvznemcaaef2br0s1co","wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u","brr1zrug1jl02gi80d1dv8c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n[![Great Extinction](/assets/extinctions.jpeg)](/notes/wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u/) \n> (_Courtesy: [Hong Kong Freepress](https://hongkongfp.com/2021/11/28/explainer-over-50-groups-gone-in-11-months-how-hong-kongs-pro-democracy-forces-crumbled/), 2021_) \n\nSHKO (Save Hong Kong Online) is a community-driven project dedicated to preserving the rapidly disappearing websites and online resources of Hong Kong’s civil society and independent media since 2019. In response to the sweeping shutdowns caused by political changes in Hong Kong, we aim to safeguard digital heritage before it vanishes. This project is anonymous, open source, and supported by a global network of contributors.\n\nWhile most sites in our archive were forced offline due to Hong Kong’s political deterioration, it’s important to note that [[RFA Cantonese|sites.rfa_cantonese]] is the only site here closed not because of Hong Kong’s situation, but due to internal political decisions in the United States.\n\nExplore our full list of preserved sites and archives on the [Collections page](/notes/wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u/).\n\n## Goals\n- To preserve as much information as possible before its disappearance during Hong Kong's great transition\n- To illustrate a viable method that everyone can use to help preserve online heritage with no pains\n- To demonstrate global collaborations to save local digital heritages with best practices\n\n## Quick Facts\n\nWe are working on over dozens of [[websites or online causes | sites]] in Hong Kong in the past two decades which has been forced to shutdown or at the brink of disappearing. We'd welcome anyone help [[contribute | howto]] to the content and/or [[sponsor | sponsorship]] our program to sustain it together. \n\nExamples:\n- [[sites.appledaily]] (Extincted)\n- [[sites.inmediahk]] (In Danger)\n\n\n\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"siteUrl":"https://savehkonline.org","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"logoPath":"vault/assets/yellow_black_logo.png","enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Save Hong Kong Online","description":"Using community driven backup services to backup Hong Kong's extincting web heritages"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/China-Digital-Times-CDT/wepreserve"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"enablePrettyRefs":true,"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root","enableTaskNotes":true,"searchMode":"lookup"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
