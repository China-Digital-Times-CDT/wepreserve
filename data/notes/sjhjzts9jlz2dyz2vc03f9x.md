民間人權陣線（英語：Civil Human Rights Front，簡稱：民陣）曾是香港一個關注政治及民主議題的聯合平台，在該組織巔峰時期，幾乎所有香港民主派成員都參與其中，但在《港區國安法》實施後，大量成員先後退出團體。民間人權陣線最為人熟悉的是於2003年起每年主辦香港七一遊行。此後，民主派所發動的示威遊行皆以民陣的名義進行，直至2021年8月13日宣佈解散。(URL: http://www.civilhrfront.org/)

The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) was an organisation that focused on the issues of Hong Kong politics and livelihood, affiliated with almost all pan-democratic camps in Hong Kong. It was founded on 13 September 2002 and disbanded on 15 August 2021. Forty-eight NGOs and political groups were involved in the organisation in January 2006. The most well-known event held by the CHRF was the Hong Kong 1 July marches. (URL: http://www.civilhrfront.org/)
