SHKO (Save Hong Kong Online) is a community-driven project dedicated to preserving the rapidly disappearing websites and online resources of Hong Kong’s civil society and independent media since 2019. In response to the sweeping shutdowns caused by political changes in Hong Kong, we aim to safeguard digital heritage before it vanishes. This project is anonymous, open source, and supported by a global network of contributors.

While most sites in our archive were forced offline due to Hong Kong’s political deterioration, it’s important to note that [[RFA Cantonese|sites.rfa_cantonese]] is the only site here closed not because of Hong Kong’s situation, but due to internal political decisions in the United States.

Explore our full list of preserved sites and archives on the [[Collections page|/notes/wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u/]].   


## Goals
- To preserve as much information as possible before its disappearance during Hong Kong's great transition
- To illustrate a viable method that everyone can use to help preserve online heritage with no pains
- To demonstrate global collaborations to save local digital heritages with best practices
