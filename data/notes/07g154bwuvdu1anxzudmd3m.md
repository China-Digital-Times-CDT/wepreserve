The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) is a defunct trade union organisation. Founded in July 1990, it led a number of labour movements and at its peak had more than 90 affiliated unions with over 190,000 members. It had 78 affiliates by the time of its dissolution in October 2021, and was once one of the largest trade union federations in Hong Kong. The head office of the CTU was located on the 7th and 19th floors of Aeon Hong Kong, 557-559 Nathan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The former Chairman of the HKCTU is Representative Wong Nai-yuen, and Lee Cheuk-yan is the Secretary General. The four main platforms of the HKCTU are unity, dignity, justice and democracy. On 17 September 2021, Wen Wei Po reported that the executive committee of the HKCTU held a meeting on the evening of 16 September and approved the decision to initiate the dissolution process, and that a general meeting would be held on 3 October to formally endorse the dissolution. Reportedly, Mr Mong Siu-tat, who has been the General Secretary since 2012, has announced his resignation. Speaking to reporters after the meeting on 3 October 2021, HKCTU Chairman Wong Nai-yuen said the dissolution was approved by a majority of 57 votes in favour, 8 against and 2 abstentions. The 31-year old HKCTU was officially dissolved. (URL： http://www.hkctu.org.hk/, inaccessible)
