2019年5月香港特區政府提出「逃犯條例」修訂案，引發反送中運動，一班牧者看見在動盪不安社會中的牧養需要，組成了一個臨時組織，名為「香港基督教教牧聯署籌委會」，並由30位牧者發起公開的教牧聯署，表明其決意「守護真理、拒絕謊言」，要求政府撤回條例修訂，合共八百多位牧者參與聯署。於2020年8月，該組織核心人員離港，原有班底宣佈解散。(URL: https://hkpastors.net/)

In May 2019, the Hong Kong SAR Government proposed the Extradiction Law Amendment Bill, which triggered the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement. Seeing the need for pastoral care in a volatile society, a group of pastors formed a temporary organization called the "Hong Kong Christian Pastoral Organizing Committee" and 30 pastors launched a public pastoral coalition, stating their determination to "defend the truth and reject lies" and requesting the Government to withdraw the amendments to the bill. In August 2020, the key pastors of the network left Hong Kong. The organisation was disbanded accordingly. (URL: https://hkpastors.net/)
