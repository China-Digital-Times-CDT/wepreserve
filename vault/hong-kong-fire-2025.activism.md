## Vigils and Mourning
- Three-day citywide mourning (Nov 29–Dec 1): flags at half-mast across government sites and overseas offices; condolence books open in all 18 districts; public hotlines for casualty inquiries and mental health support (SCMP).
- On-site memorials and note removals reported; residents continued placing messages nearby.
- Mourners at Wang Fuk Court displayed placards reading “要检讨嘅唔系竹棚 而系个制度” (“Review the system, not the bamboo”), rejecting attempts to blame bamboo scaffolding for the spread (RFI).
- WSJ described thousands gathering on Dec 1 to lay flowers and donate supplies; ad-hoc relief booths were later replaced by police command tents as authorities formalized the site ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).
- “頭七” memorial (Dec 2): Kowloon Funeral Parlour opened East Hall for three days (from Nov 30) to let the public mourn; projection screen displayed e-condolences, including calls for “公義” and “徹查真相.” Hundreds—students in uniform, nearby office workers—queued through lunch to lay flowers; sobbing and paper-offering folding reported despite weekday timing (local reports).
- Diaspora vigil (Dec 5): Hong Kongers in Britain (HKB) plan a London memorial 6–8:30 p.m. at 1 Coral Street, SE1 with altar, Lennon Wall, silent area; expected 200–300 attendees; organizers call for an open, transparent inquiry (Points Media).
- Diaspora vigil (Dec 6): Toronto/North York memorial 4:30–5:30 p.m. at North York Memorial Community Hall, 5110 Yonge St, with doors open from 4:00 for flowers; Lennon Wall and petition signing for an independent inquiry remain open afterward (Hong Kong-Canada Association via A1 Chinese Radio).
- Diaspora vigil (Dec 7): Community notice for a New York prayer service at Transfiguration Church, 29 Mott Street, 4:00 p.m.; clergy to lead benediction with hymn singing from 3:00 p.m.; open invitation to mourn Wang Fuk Court victims.

## Accountability and Detentions
- Petitions/leaflets: Arrests of student Miles Kwan (petition >10k signatures), former district councillor Kenneth Cheung, and volunteer surnamed Li over accountability leaflets/messages (RFI/HKFP).
- Protests/vigils calling for independent investigation; police/security officials warned against “misinformation.”
- Volunteer clampdown: ABC reported volunteers and NGOs distributing food and support were told to leave the site on Dec 1, reflecting official concern over gatherings; its “One fire, two systems” piece links the petition arrest and aid withdrawal to Beijing’s red lines on grief and accountability ([ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-02/tai-po-fire-hong-kong-mainland-grief-red-lines/106087732)).
- Election context: Government said Dec 7 LegCo campaign activities would pause while authorities address the fire; activists’ online petition echoed 2019 protest demands, and rights groups warned the National Security Law chills discussion of the disaster (WSJ).
- Civil society presser (Dec 2) on high-rise repair policy canceled less than four hours before start after organizer Law Shing-lai (ADPL) met National Security police; HKFP reports solicitor and former ADPL chair Bruce Liu was taken in by the national security department ahead of the event. The agenda included resident support, an inquiry demand, potential bid-rigging/substandard materials, and regulator roles; slated speakers included ADPL’s Kwok Wai-shing and Jay Li plus town planner/former Democratic Party member Stanley Ng ([InMediaHK](https://www.inmediahk.net/node/%E6%94%BF%E7%B6%93/%E3%80%90%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%E3%80%91%E6%B0%91%E9%96%93%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E6%9C%83%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88-%E5%BB%96%E6%88%90%E5%88%A9%E8%A2%AB%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%89%E8%99%95%E9%82%80%E6%9C%83%E9%9D%A2%EF%BC%9A%E5%B7%B2%E7%B0%BD%E4%BF%9D%E5%AF%86%E5%8D%94%E8%AD%B0%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E9%80%8F%E9%9C%B2?utm_source=dable) [HKFP](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/02/hong-kong-solicitor-taken-in-by-nat-sec-police-as-civic-press-event-on-deadly-tai-po-blaze-axed/)).
- Owners’ committee accountability: DAB-linked advisor Wong Bik-kiu vows police/ICAC reports over alleged misconduct and safety risks; highlights man-made disaster framing and calls for full accountability (DotDotNews/HK01).
- Public commentary on accountability: Threads posts highlight lack of official resignations after ~200 dead/missing and cite AFP question to John Lee (“Can you tell us why you deserve to keep your job?”) ([Threads](https://www.threads.com/@kaminghk/post/DRxEWgCj7mz?xmt=AQF0Y8QlE4EeoRWNRx0-ZokkHaRfuw3I-2LSifPZ25bpOQ)).

## Narrative and Information Control
- National security posture: Beijing’s national-security office warned it would punish anyone “exploiting” the fire for political ends, accused “anti-China” actors of spreading false information, and threatened arrests of those directing anger at the government. A person distributing fliers for an independent inquiry was detained and later bailed ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2)).
- Disappearances/online takedowns: Threads/X accounts of Hailey Cheng (a.k.a. 金冬菇, founder of the GitHub “Hong Kong Fire Documentary” project) were removed early Dec 3; her phone unreachable, prompting fears she was taken for questioning over “seditious” information ([Threads](https://www.threads.com/@bravedogdog/post/DRxuZY8DOEH?xmt=AQF0lSY3idOhbSWh9l93EEyPuDBCKVB3sWO-7wYF0_7GxA)).
- Narrative contest: Global Voices op-ed (Dec 2) says the fire was man-made—rooted in MBIS tender/oversight failures and ignored complaints—and urges an independent inquiry; criticizes scapegoating bamboo and notes student arrest over a petition and pulled Ta Kung Pao bid-rigging reports as evidence of suppression ([Global Voices](https://globalvoices.org/2025/12/02/critics-say-hong-kong-fire-was-due-to-negligence-not-scaffolding/)).
- International media framing: AP (Dec 2) describes a “tip of an iceberg,” highlighting 7 of 20 net samples failing, alleged cost-cutting net swaps, alarms not sounding, suspension of 28 other projects, and national-security arrests of petition organizers amid concerns of systemic bid-rigging and weak oversight ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-wang-china-dissent-fire-construction-ff953aec2bc0201b0e3255805a241fc1)).
