## Key Facts (as of 2025-12-17)
- **Impact and scale**: Fire began ~2:52 p.m. on Nov 26, 2025 at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po (~2,000 flats/~4,600 residents; ~40% aged 65+). Seven of eight towers burned; 200 fire trucks, 100 ambulances, and >800 firefighters/paramedics deployed. Building fatalities: Wang Tai 82, Wang Cheong 70, Wang Sun 3, Wang Do 2, Wang Shing 1; none in Wang Yan/Wang Kin/Wang Chi; one victim not yet tied to a block (UDN/Ming Pao/TVBS/DotDotNews). SPCA estimates >537 animals affected; 364 found (294 survived, 70 died, 173 missing) ([RTHK](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1834467-20251203.htm)).
- **Materials and systems**: Highly flammable polystyrene and foam panels blocked windows and escape routes; alarms found non-functional across all towers (some residents say alarms were switched off during works). Officials say 7 of 20 scaffold-net samples failed fire-resistance tests; allegations of mesh swapping to evade inspections ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-wang-china-dissent-fire-construction-ff953aec2bc0201b0e3255805a241fc1)). Elevator-lobby windows reportedly sealed with foam boards; residents complained in 2024 about flammable netting/foam ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-warned.html)). PolyU’s Xinyan Huang later clarified remarks on bamboo’s role and urged caution pending a full technical study.
- **Oversight and investigations**: 15 manslaughter arrests tied to alleged gross negligence; ICAC probe made multiple arrests linked to the renovation project, including on Dec 17 the current OC chairperson Tsui Mun-kam (徐滿柑) and former chairperson Tang Kwok-kuen (鄧國權), who signed the HK$330m contract during his five consecutive terms as chair (2012–Sep 2024) ([on.cc](https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20251217/bkn-20251217175140460-1217_00822_001.html)). Chief Executive John Lee announced a non-statutory judge-led committee, promising administrative directives in lieu of a statutory inquiry; on Dec 12 he said the panel chaired by Judge David Lok will report within nine months and will probe systemic construction risks, conflicts, collusion, and bid-rigging ([Tweet](https://x.com/haileyhmt/status/1995860431177449729?s=46) [Reuters/Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/12/12/asia-pacific/hong-kong-fire-probe/)). Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme tender reportedly jumped from ~HK$140m to HK$330m; residents alleged bid-rigging and triad-linked interference. URA says its 100/100 “project management” score for the main contractor under the Building Rehab Company Registration Scheme will be clarified and the scoring method revised ([HKEJ](https://www.hkej.com/instantnews/article?id=4264192)).
- **Response and support**: Insurance Authority task force coordinating outreach; ~8,700 policies tied to Wang Fuk Court (1,100 general, 7,600 life) identified ([Yahoo](https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%EF%BD%9C%E4%BF%9D%E7%9B%A3%E5%B1%80%EF%BC%9A%E6%B6%89%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BF%9D%E5%96%AE%E5%85%B1-8700-%E5%BC%B5-%E5%B7%B2%E8%A8%AD%E5%B0%88%E8%B2%AC%E5%B0%8F%E7%B5%84%E5%8D%94%E8%AA%BF%EF%BD%9Cyahoo-073800120.html)).

The Collective HK profiled a Wang Tai House family: father, grandmother, Indonesian helper “Sandy,” and 15-month-old “Yan Yan” died after a 7-hour call with relatives who say alarms stayed silent and foam-board-sealed windows left them stranded while firefighters said they could not “attack” 14/F ([The Collective HK](https://thecollectivehk.com/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%EF%BD%9C%E5%AE%B6%E5%B1%AC%E7%97%9B%E6%86%B6%E4%B8%83%E5%B0%8F%E6%99%82%E6%B1%82%E6%95%91%E9%80%9A%E8%A9%B1%E3%80%80%E5%A5%BD%E7%88%B8%E7%88%B8/?media_id=3786041531569256701_63468865757&media_author_id=63468865757&ranking_info_token=GCAwZDY5MDBlNjUzNTg0OTMyYTdjMTJlOTRlYjRhNDdiMiW4m6IFFdgEFoaG45MNGBMzNzg2MDQxNTMxNTY5MjU2NzAxKANuY2cA&utm_source=ig_text_feed_timeline)).
