## Victims and Residents

- Wang Tai House family — A 15-month-old girl “Yan Yan,” her father, grandmother, and Indonesian helper “Sandy” died after a 7-hour call with relatives “Jack” and “Ali” who stayed on the line while foam-board-sealed windows, silent alarms, and heat trapped the four on 14/F; firefighters told them they could not “attack” the floor before the call went dead, and Sandy was later found near the stairwell ([The Collective HK](https://thecollectivehk.com/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%EF%BD%9C%E5%AE%B6%E5%B1%AC%E7%97%9B%E6%86%B6%E4%B8%83%E5%B0%8F%E6%99%82%E6%B1%82%E6%95%91%E9%80%9A%E8%A9%B1%E3%80%80%E5%A5%BD%E7%88%B8%E7%88%B8/?media_id=3786041531569256701_63468865757&media_author_id=63468865757&ranking_info_token=GCAwZDY5MDBlNjUzNTg0OTMyYTdjMTJlOTRlYjRhNDdiMiW4m6IFFdgEFoaG45MNGBMzNzg2MDQxNTMxNTY5MjU2NzAxKANuY2cA&utm_source=ig_text_feed_timeline)).

- Families awaiting DNA ID — HKSKH social worker Chan Mo-ning says some relatives cannot visually identify remains and may wait months for DNA confirmation, deepening anxiety ([am730](https://www.am730.com.hk/%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0/%E5%A4%A7%E5%9F%94%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB-%E8%81%96%E5%85%AC%E6%9C%83-%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E8%BE%A8%E8%AA%8D%E9%81%BA%E9%AB%94%E6%88%96%E9%9C%80%E6%95%B8%E6%9C%88%E9%A9%97dna-%E5%AE%B6%E5%B1%AC%E9%99%B7%E5%BE%AC%E5%BE%A8/624057)).

Rescued her employer Kanon Chung's 3-month-old baby and elderly mother from their smoke-filled Wang Fuk Court flat before firefighters reached them. All three were admitted to intensive care but in stable condition. Previously worked 2 years in Qatar and 4+ years caring for Rhoda Lynn Dayo's children in the Philippines. Audio messages she sent to her sister during the blaze went viral. Senator Imee Marcos visited her in hospital and praised her as a "true modern-day hero"; Overseas Workers Welfare Administration called her a "model of compassion and courage" ([AsiaOne](https://www.asiaone.com/asia/philippines-celebrates-heroic-helper-who-survived-hong-kong-fire)).

## Experts and Analysts

Reportedly filmed and emailed Fire Services leadership multiple times (e.g., 2024-05-17) warning of non-compliant scaffolding netting at Wang Fuk Court; says no action was taken. [Warning video](https://www.facebook.com/JasonPoonHongKong/videos/1589328408575284/?vh=e&fs=e&mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=CejPpFlbwxgf5749#).

Said homeowners are often at a disadvantage in renovation projects because they do not understand technicalities of contracts and many fear legal threats; after the fire, expressed hope the tragedy will bring more accountability: "It's no longer just about one estate, it's about whether the entire building-maintenance system has been compromised" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).
