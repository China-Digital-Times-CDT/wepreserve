### Pre-2025 Context
- **2017 (background)** FactWire publishes a building-maintenance bidding database (~3,000 bids across 220 estates) showing widespread bid-rigging patterns—context for later Wang Fuk Court tender concerns [FactWire](https://www.dotdotnews.com/a/202512/01/AP692d69ede4b0c32d4f618e05.html).
- **2023 (MBIS tender)** After the MBIS tender is set, projected costs rise from ~HK$140m to HK$330m; residents allege bid-rigging and report suspected triad-linked figures blocking dissenting owners from meetings. A new owners’ corporation replaces the old one in Sep 2024 but the contract is already signed (RFI).
- **2024-05-17** Contractor and whistleblower Jason Poon (Pan Zhuohong) reports use of non-compliant scaffolding netting at Wang Fuk Court, recording videos and sending multiple emails to the Fire Services Director; concerns reportedly not acted on.
- **2024-07** Owners’ briefing on the HK$330m repair: residents object to rushed scope and lack of consultation; a lawyer warns that stopping the contract after a committee change could trigger owner liability. Residents say they tipped ICAC before contract signing but were told to supply evidence and saw no probe ([i-Cable](https://www.i-cable.com/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E8%B3%87%E8%A8%8A/415811/%E4%B8%80%E7%B7%9A%E6%90%9C%E6%9F%A5-%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB%E8%83%8C%E5%BE%8C-%E4%B8%89%E7%96%91%E9%BB%9E%E6%83%B9%E9%97%9C%E6%B3%A8-%E5%B1%85%E6%B0%91)).
- **2024-09** Residents complain to the Labor Department about flammable scaffolding netting and foam boards sealing windows; department initially says netting not regulated, later cites contractor certificates and notes 16 inspections with notices/prosecutions but allows works to continue [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-warned.html).
