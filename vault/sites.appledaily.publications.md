> Apple Daily (蘋果日報) was Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai in 1995. On June 24, 2021, after 26 years of publication, the newspaper was forced to close following the arrest of its executives under the National Security Law. These two publications represent pivotal moments in Hong Kong's struggle for press freedom and democracy.

## Historical Significance

### The Closure of Apple Daily

On June 17, 2021, 500 police officers raided Apple Daily's headquarters. Five executives were arrested on charges of "collusion with foreign forces." On June 23, the company announced it would cease operations, and the final edition was printed on June 24, 2021.

The closure marked a significant turning point for press freedom in Hong Kong, as the city lost its most outspoken pro-democracy voice.

### The 2019 Protests

The Anti-ELAB movement began in March 2019 against a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. At its peak, an estimated 2 million people (out of a population of 7.5 million) participated in protests. The movement's "Five Demands, Not One Less" became a rallying cry for democracy.
