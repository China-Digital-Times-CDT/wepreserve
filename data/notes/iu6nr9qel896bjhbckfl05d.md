## Archive the whole site

If you are a developer, you can run up this docker container(https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) to save a web site as a whole. The saved site will be compressed into a single file as a snapshot from the specific date(time). The file is in a popular compression format called [WACZ](https://webrecorder.github.io/wacz-spec/1.1.1/).
