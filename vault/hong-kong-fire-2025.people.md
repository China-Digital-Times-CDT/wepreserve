- Wang Tai House family — A 15-month-old girl “Yan Yan,” her father, grandmother, and Indonesian helper “Sandy” died after a 7-hour call with relatives “Jack” and “Ali” who stayed on the line while foam-board-sealed windows, silent alarms, and heat trapped the four on 14/F; firefighters told them they could not “attack” the floor before the call went dead, and Sandy was later found near the stairwell ([The Collective HK](https://thecollectivehk.com/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%EF%BD%9C%E5%AE%B6%E5%B1%AC%E7%97%9B%E6%86%B6%E4%B8%83%E5%B0%8F%E6%99%82%E6%B1%82%E6%95%91%E9%80%9A%E8%A9%B1%E3%80%80%E5%A5%BD%E7%88%B8%E7%88%B8/?media_id=3786041531569256701_63468865757&media_author_id=63468865757&ranking_info_token=GCAwZDY5MDBlNjUzNTg0OTMyYTdjMTJlOTRlYjRhNDdiMiW4m6IFFdgEFoaG45MNGBMzNzg2MDQxNTMxNTY5MjU2NzAxKANuY2cA&utm_source=ig_text_feed_timeline)).
- Apple Tong — illustrator and Wang Fuk Court resident who lost all art supplies when the fire spread to her block; she and her mother escaped after smelling smoke despite sealed windows and no alarm, and she reported community donations of replacement tools after sharing her story ([Artnet](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/hong-kong-fire-bamboo-culture-2723917)).
- Families awaiting DNA ID — HKSKH social worker Chan Mo-ning says some relatives cannot visually identify remains and may wait months for DNA confirmation, deepening anxiety ([am730](https://www.am730.com.hk/%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0/%E5%A4%A7%E5%9F%94%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB-%E8%81%96%E5%85%AC%E6%9C%83-%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E8%BE%A8%E8%AA%8D%E9%81%BA%E9%AB%94%E6%88%96%E9%9C%80%E6%95%B8%E6%9C%88%E9%A9%97dna-%E5%AE%B6%E5%B1%AC%E9%99%B7%E5%BE%AC%E5%BE%A8/624057)).
- Rhodora Alcaraz (nickname "Jackie") — 28-year-old Filipino domestic helper who arrived in Hong Kong just one day before the fire. Rescued her employer Kanon Chung's 3-month-old baby and elderly mother from their smoke-filled Wang Fuk Court flat before firefighters reached them. All three were admitted to intensive care but in stable condition. Previously worked 2 years in Qatar and 4+ years caring for Rhoda Lynn Dayo's children in the Philippines. Audio messages she sent to her sister during the blaze went viral. Senator Imee Marcos visited her in hospital and praised her as a "true modern-day hero"; Overseas Workers Welfare Administration called her a "model of compassion and courage" ([AsiaOne](https://www.asiaone.com/asia/philippines-celebrates-heroic-helper-who-survived-hong-kong-fire)).
- Cheng Hui-kiu 鄭煦翹 ("Hannah") — 5-year-old girl living at Wang Tai House 24/F who died with her Filipino helper Maryan while attempting to escape. Just turned 5 on Nov 11, 2025, described by parents as "very well-behaved, helpful," a class monitor who assisted classmates. Door camera footage shows she and Maryan left their flat at 3:13 p.m. on Nov 26 (within 3 minutes of Maryan detecting the fire) when corridors were still smoke-free; within 5 minutes the 24/F elevator lobby was engulfed in dense smoke. Hannah's body was found in a low-floor stairwell on the morning of Nov 27; cause of death: smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. Parents believe a maintenance worker tried to help her escape after Maryan collapsed but both were overcome by smoke on floors 2–3. Family had planned a Dec mid-month trip to Vietnam. Parents now call the fire a "man-made disaster" and say Hannah and Maryan died "wrongfully" ([The Collective HK](https://thecollectivehk.com/%e5%ae%8f%e7%a6%8f%e8%8b%91%e7%81%ab%e7%81%bd%e4%ba%94%e6%ad%b2%e7%85%a6%e7%bf%b9%e8%8f%b2%e5%82%ad%e5%91%bd%e5%96%aa%e4%bd%8e%e5%b1%a4%e5%90%b8%e6%bf%83%e7%85%99%e8%87%b4%e6%ad%bb%e9%9b%99%e8%a6%aa/)).
- Maryan Pascual Esteban — 40-year-old Filipino domestic helper who died protecting 5-year-old Hannah Cheng while evacuating Wang Tai House 24/F. Worked for the Zheng family 4+ years, signing her third contract in Sep 2025; previously worked 10 years in Lebanon and was skilled at cooking Middle Eastern cuisine. On Nov 26 at ~3:10 p.m., smelled burning, looked out window, saw Wang Cheong on fire, and within 3 minutes woke Hannah from her nap and evacuated. Body found at 9/F elevator lobby, blackened by smoke; died from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. Single mother to a 10-year-old son in the Philippines whom she supported alone; had planned to return home for 2 weeks in Dec mid-month. Parents say she was "No. 1," treated like family, and had traveled with them to Japan in Oct 2024. Funeral held in Hong Kong before Christmas; body repatriated to the Philippines ([The Collective HK](https://thecollectivehk.com/%e5%ae%8f%e7%a6%8f%e8%8b%91%e7%81%ab%e7%81%bd%e4%ba%94%e6%ad%b2%e7%85%a6%e7%bf%b9%e8%8f%b2%e5%82%ad%e5%91%bd%e5%96%aa%e4%bd%8e%e5%b1%a4%e5%90%b8%e6%bf%83%e7%85%99%e8%87%b4%e6%ad%bb%e9%9b%99%e8%a6%aa/)).
- Phyllis Lo (盧女士) — 48-year-old Hong Kong resident whose 74-year-old mother died in the fire. Her mother called her after seeing thick smoke outside her door; knowing she might not survive, she asked Lo and her brother to "live well." Lo rushed to her childhood home and called again minutes later—no one answered. Police confirmed her mother's death the next morning. Lo wonders if the tragedy could have been avoided had departments done better; says what bothers her most is lack of transparency on when she can see her burnt apartment and how the HK$589m relief fund will be used. Hopes the nine-month investigation will release findings. Made turnip cakes for Lunar New Year—a tradition inherited from her mother—and said in tears: "Maybe she is still everywhere and still seeing us now. I really want to be with her" ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).

## Displaced Residents
- Pearl Chow (周女士) — 87-year-old resident who fled her apartment clutching essential documents including her title deed. Now living in a ~100 sq ft temporary housing unit, separated from her grandson on a different floor. Still regularly returns to Tai Po for church and grocery shopping despite the hourlong journey; wants to be resettled in Tai Po, where she lived for decades. Joked: "I am an elderly person. When they finish building, I may have gone to my heavenly home." Lost old photos in the fire ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).
- Dorz Cheung (張先生) — 33-year-old grandson of Pearl Chow who rushed from his office to find her safe while the fire was still raging; watched the flames for hours, crying while clutching a friend. Now in a separate temporary housing unit (~100 sq ft) on a different floor from his grandmother. Says the unit is not a home: "Only a permanent residence can be a home." Lost his sense of security with the authorities after the blaze; says Jan 2026 government proposals on bid-rigging and fire safety still haven't addressed resettlement: "We can only wait, being tossed around like a ball" ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).
- Kit Chan (陳女士) — 74-year-old resident who lived with her husband in a 460 sq ft apartment for over 40 years, raising their family in a community where neighbors helped look after each other's children. Planned to spend the rest of her life there. Now in a studio unit at a youth hostel half the size of her old apartment; worried about being asked to leave after hearing other fire victims were told to move out. Says: "It's like being unable to get by in my final years." Initially wanted to be resettled in a new home built on the fire site, but the ~10-year rebuilding timeline changed her mind; could now accept a similar-sized apartment in another district with good transport ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).
- Keung Mak (麥先生) — 78-year-old husband of Kit Chan. Hopes they can at least return to see their old home: "Many people hope they can at least see how badly it was burned" ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).
- Isaac Tam (譚先生) — 23-year-old resident whose family lost two apartments in the fire; his parents cried and his 92-year-old grandfather grew thinner. During past Lunar New Years, the family used to visit neighbors with gifts—now those familiar faces are scattered across the city. As of Feb 2026, preparing to move into temporary homes smaller and farther from the city center; spent money to renovate them. Worries about his grandfather adjusting to a new district, away from his morning dim sum routine with friends in Tai Po. Mulling apartments in another district that could be ready sooner, prioritizing time over location given his grandfather's age: "I fear he can't wait until we secure an apartment of about 400 square feet" ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d)).

## Experts and Analysts
- José Luis Torero — UCL civil/environmental engineering head and Grenfell Tower inquiry expert; says Wang Fuk Court's vertical spread and smoke overrunning escape routes resemble Grenfell, points to combustible foam/polystyrene and channel-flow between closely spaced towers as likely drivers over bamboo, and calls for a Grenfell-level technical probe into materials, compartmentation, spacing, and smoke-path failure ([Yahoo/信報](https://hk.finance.yahoo.com/news/%E8%8B%B1%E7%81%AB%E7%81%BD%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%A5%E5%B0%88%E5%AE%B6-%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%A4%B1%E6%95%88%E7%8C%9B%E6%96%BC%E7%81%AB-2017%E5%80%AB%E6%95%A6%E4%BD%8F%E5%AE%85%E5%A4%A7%E5%BB%88%E7%87%92%E9%80%9A%E9%A0%82-%E8%88%87%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E7%9B%B8%E4%BC%BC-184700834.html)).
- Per Hansen — Nordnet investment economist; warned ISS A/S could face a costly, lengthy probe and short-seller pressure after its property-management role surfaced; ISS shares fell up to 11% on Dec 2 despite being up >50% over the past year ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/iss-shares-plunge-after-hong-kong-launches-apartment-fire-probe)).
- Alfred Tang (鄧文彬) — President of the Hong Kong Institute of Construction Managers; 30 years in the building industry including as construction manager. Said the renovation market is "a big piece of fatty pork" (Cantonese saying for lucrative business) and that bid-rigging has spread across the city since 2012; warned that consultants involved in bid-rigging "lose their independence in ensuring that safe, quality repair work is carried out" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).
- Martin Loosemore — Professor of construction management at the University of Technology Sydney; said Hong Kong's mandatory building inspection law is "among the strictest in the world" for high-rises but has "created pressure on a system already vulnerable to corruption," noting corruption plagues the construction industry globally ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).

Donations included HK$1M from G-Dragon plus support from SM, Hybe, JYP, Ive, Stray Kids, and others; Michelle Yeoh canceled appearance; a “KPop Demon Hunters” performance was dropped for tone sensitivity [Korea Herald](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10626450).

## Whistleblowers
- 潘焯鴻 (Jason Poon / Pan Zhuohong) — Contractor and chairman of CHINAT Engineering (中科監察); whistleblower in a 2018 scandal involving substandard work on Hong Kong's Shatin-Central metro line. Reportedly filmed and emailed Fire Services leadership multiple times (e.g., 2024-05-17) warning of non-compliant scaffolding netting at Wang Fuk Court; says no action was taken. [Warning video](https://www.facebook.com/JasonPoonHongKong/videos/1589328408575284/?vh=e&fs=e&mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=CejPpFlbwxgf5749#). Worked with residents who complained to the Labor Department about flammable netting and foam boards in Sep 2024; officials cited contractor certificates after 16 inspections and some notices/prosecutions but allowed works to continue [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-warned.html). Said homeowners are often at a disadvantage in renovation projects because they do not understand technicalities of contracts and many fear legal threats; after the fire, expressed hope the tragedy will bring more accountability: "It's no longer just about one estate, it's about whether the entire building-maintenance system has been compromised" ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-30/hong-kong-fire-reveals-corruption-in-city-s-renovation-industry)).
