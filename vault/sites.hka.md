香港市民支援愛國民主運動聯合會，簡稱支聯會或港支聯， 是香港曾經一個泛民主派政治組織，於1989年5月21日在香港支持八九民運的全球華人大遊行中成立，設有包括「釋放民運人士、平反八九民運」等在內的五大綱領，首屆主席由司徒華擔任。1990年至2019年，支聯會曾連續30年無間斷舉辦六四遊行、維園燭光集會。高峰期時，泛民主派有約一半的立法會議員同時身兼支聯會成員身份。2021年9月25日，特別會員大會通過解散決議。(URL: http://www.alliance.org.hk/, invalid) (FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/hkalliance)

The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China was a pro-democracy organisation that was established on 21 May 1989 in the then British colony of Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in Beijing. After the 4 June massacre, the organisation main goals were the rehabilitation of the democracy movement and the accountability for the massacre. The main activities the organisation held were the annual memorials and commemorations, of which the candlelight vigil in Victoria Park was the most attended, reported and discussed event each year. Due to its stance, the Central government in Beijing considers the organisation subversive. Three leaders, including its vice chairwoman Chow Hang-tung were arrested on other national security charges on 9 September 2021, and its assets were frozen. The Alliance finally decided to dissolve on 25 September after all standing committee members were remanded in custody or jailed.
