Since 2020, Hong Kong has been imposed a National Security Law by the central government, given the strong backslash from the local and international communities. 

After NSL was put into practice, the civil society has suffered huge losses by not only losing key activists but also their projects and public information channels. 

The idea of SHKO was from a common concern mounted from a series of crackdowns in Hong Kong and disappearance of many media outlets, as well Non-governmental organizations. The list of dangerous projects is growing longer and longer with no time to respond by civil society, especially on how to preserve their legacy content and valuable history documents, whether in digital or traditional formats. 


A team of digital activists are working on an new initiative, collaborating with this project, to develop some open tools to preserve these historical cluster of content, and set up an example and model to be used by any similar social/political environment. 

The goal of this initiative is to collect the extinct content from those organizations and create an online archive at the beginning, then technologies will be used to keep the content last for a visible duration(10 years and on), and eventually shared and safeguarded by public crowd. 

The extending goal of the project is to make such a preservation a common model by open-source all the details(except the participant's private information). Hence it can be reused by other similar projects.
