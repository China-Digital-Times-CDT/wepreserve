<p>A catastrophic fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, Hong Kong, engulfed seven of eight residential towers on November 26, 2025—the city's deadliest fire since 1948. Authorities cite gross negligence in renovation works as a key driver of the blaze and its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Status snapshot (2026-02-10): 168 dead (58 males, 110 females; youngest 6 months, oldest 98; final forensic analysis complete—all bodies identified via teeth/DNA); 79 injured; one firefighter confirmed dead; 10 foreign domestic workers dead and 5 injured. SPCA reports 364 animals found (294 survived, 70 died, 173 missing).

<ul>
<li><strong>Impact and scale</strong>: Fire began ~2:52 p.m. on Nov 26, 2025 at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po (~2,000 flats/~4,600 residents; ~40% aged 65+). Seven of eight towers burned; 200 fire trucks, 100 ambulances, and >800 firefighters/paramedics deployed. Building fatalities: Wang Tai 82, Wang Cheong 70, Wang Sun 3, Wang Do 2, Wang Shing 1; none in Wang Yan/Wang Kin/Wang Chi; one victim not yet tied to a block (UDN/Ming Pao/TVBS/DotDotNews). SPCA estimates >537 animals affected; 364 found (294 survived, 70 died, 173 missing) (<a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1834467-20251203.htm">RTHK</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Materials and systems</strong>: Highly flammable polystyrene and foam panels blocked windows and escape routes; alarms found non-functional across all towers (some residents say alarms were switched off during works). Officials say 7 of 20 scaffold-net samples failed fire-resistance tests; allegations of mesh swapping to evade inspections (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-wang-china-dissent-fire-construction-ff953aec2bc0201b0e3255805a241fc1">AP</a>). Elevator-lobby windows reportedly sealed with foam boards; residents complained in 2024 about flammable netting/foam (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/asia/hong-kong-fire-officials-warned.html">NYT</a>). PolyU’s Xinyan Huang later clarified remarks on bamboo’s role and urged caution pending a full technical study.</li>
<li><strong>Oversight and investigations</strong>: 16 manslaughter arrests tied to alleged gross negligence; ICAC probe made multiple arrests linked to the renovation project, including on Dec 17 the current OC chairperson Tsui Mun-kam (徐滿柑) and former chairperson Tang Kwok-kuen (鄧國權), who signed the HK$330m contract during his five consecutive terms as chair (2012–Sep 2024) (<a href="https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20251217/bkn-20251217175140460-1217_00822_001.html">on.cc</a>). Chief Executive John Lee announced a non-statutory judge-led committee, promising administrative directives in lieu of a statutory inquiry; on Dec 12 he said the panel chaired by Judge David Lok will report within nine months and will probe systemic construction risks, conflicts, collusion, and bid-rigging (<a href="https://x.com/haileyhmt/status/1995860431177449729?s=46">Tweet</a> <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/12/12/asia-pacific/hong-kong-fire-probe/">Reuters/Japan Times</a>). The committee held its first public meeting on Feb 5; Senior Counsel Victor Dawes said it has received "key information and clues" and understands the cause and systemic issues; evidence examination begins Mar 19 (<a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2026/02/05/residents-of-fire-hit-estate-urge-accountability-compensation-as-review-committee-holds-first-public-meeting/">HKFP</a>). Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme tender reportedly jumped from ~HK$140m to HK$330m; residents alleged bid-rigging and triad-linked interference. URA says its 100/100 “project management” score for the main contractor under the Building Rehab Company Registration Scheme will be clarified and the scoring method revised (<a href="https://www.hkej.com/instantnews/article?id=4264192">HKEJ</a>).</li>

<li><strong>Resettlement (as of Feb 2026)</strong>: Displaced residents in temporary housing (~100–230 sq ft units) await long-term plans; government conducted preference survey but has yet to unveil resettlement timeline. Rental grants offered for short-term housing. John Lee says city is "working hard" and that a significant proportion of homeowners have indicated willingness to sell ownership rights to the government; estimates rebuilding on fire site will take ~10 years. Over one-third of the complex's ~4,600 residents were aged 65+ per 2021 census. HK$589m relief fund established (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d">AP</a>).</li>

The Collective HK profiled a Wang Tai House family: father, grandmother, Indonesian helper "Sandy," and 15-month-old "Yan Yan" died after a 7-hour call with relatives who say alarms stayed silent and foam-board-sealed windows left them stranded while firefighters said they could not "attack" 14/F (<a href="https://thecollectivehk.com/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%EF%BD%9C%E5%AE%B6%E5%B1%AC%E7%97%9B%E6%86%B6%E4%B8%83%E5%B0%8F%E6%99%82%E6%B1%82%E6%95%91%E9%80%9A%E8%A9%B1%E3%80%80%E5%A5%BD%E7%88%B8%E7%88%B8/?media_id=3786041531569256701_63468865757&#x26;media_author_id=63468865757&#x26;ranking_info_token=GCAwZDY5MDBlNjUzNTg0OTMyYTdjMTJlOTRlYjRhNDdiMiW4m6IFFdgEFoaG45MNGBMzNzg2MDQxNTMxNTY5MjU2NzAxKANuY2cA&#x26;utm_source=ig_text_feed_timeline">The Collective HK</a>).

Filipino helper Maryan Pascual Esteban (40) died while protecting a child in her care; her son vowed to become a firefighter (<a href="https://www.threads.com/?xmt=AQF0quUUcbnWbMwcu8qs7QiIGUwf-VbM0v3MC0n7vRG1og">Threads</a>). Another Filipino helper, Rhodora Alcaraz (28), who had arrived just one day before the fire, rescued her employer's 3-month-old baby and elderly mother; her panicked audio messages went viral and she was praised by Senator Imee Marcos as a "modern-day hero" (<a href="https://www.asiaone.com/asia/philippines-celebrates-heroic-helper-who-survived-hong-kong-fire">AsiaOne</a>). The Collective HK profiled 5-year-old Cheng Hui-kiu and her helper Maryan: door cameras showed them leaving Wang Tai 24/F at 3:13 p.m. when corridors were smoke-free, but within 5 minutes dense smoke engulfed the floor; both died from smoke inhalation on lower floors, and parents call it a "man-made disaster" (<a href="https://thecollectivehk.com/%e5%ae%8f%e7%a6%8f%e8%8b%91%e7%81%ab%e7%81%bd%e4%ba%94%e6%ad%b2%e7%85%a6%e7%bf%b9%e8%8f%b2%e5%82%ad%e5%91%bd%e5%96%aa%e4%bd%8e%e5%b1%a4%e5%90%b8%e6%bf%83%e7%85%99%e8%87%b4%e6%ad%bb%e9%9b%99%e8%a6%aa/">The Collective HK</a>).

As Lunar New Year 2026 approached, AP profiled displaced families: Phyllis Lo (48) made turnip cakes—a tradition inherited from her late mother—and said in tears "I really want to be with her"; 87-year-old Pearl Chow joked she might "go to her heavenly home" before rebuilding is complete; 23-year-old Isaac Tam worries his 92-year-old grandfather cannot wait for resettlement (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-resettlement-fire-tai-po-2caedfdaee6f9460351e257cdcaeef1d">AP</a>).</li>
