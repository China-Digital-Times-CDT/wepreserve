Apple Daily was a newspaper published in Hong Kong from 1995 to 2021. Founded by Jimmy Lai, it was one of the best-selling Chinese language newspapers in Hong Kong. Along with entertainment magazine Next Magazine, Apple Daily was part of Next Digital. The paper published print and digital editions in Traditional Chinese, as well as a digital-only English edition. A sister publication of the same name remains operational online in Taiwan under a joint venture between Next Digital and other Taiwanese companies.
On 23 June 2021, the newspaper said it would close "in view of staff members' safety" and the print run of 24 June would be its last. Apple Daily also said its digital version would go offline at 23:59 Hong Kong Time on 23 June.

《蘋果日報》（英語：Apple Daily）是香港上市公司壹傳媒旗下的繁體中文報紙，由黎智英於1995年創立，是香港的主要中文報章。蘋果日報於2021年由於林鄭月娥政府以《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》拘捕多名高層並被凍結《蘋果日報》的資金，造成資金斷裂，被迫停刊。
