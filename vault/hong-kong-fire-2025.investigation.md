## Findings and Evidence
- Scaffolding netting: 7 of 20 samples failed fire-safety standards; allegations of swapping to evade inspection (NBC/AP).
- Foam/polystyrene: Panels sealed windows (incl. elevator lobbies), accelerating spread; melted at >500C and blew out windows (Reuters/CNN).
- Alarms: Post-fire inspections found alarms non-functional across all eight towers; some residents say alarms switched off during works (CNN/BBC).
- Spread origin: Initial outbreak on lower exterior of Wang Cheong House; spread to Wang Tai, Wang Shing, Wang Yan; Wang Chi largely spared (Guardian/Reuters).
- Temperature and access: Interior temps reported above 500C; falling scaffolding and debris hindered rescues (CNN/Reuters/AP).

## Arrests and Probes
- Manslaughter: 15 arrested on gross negligence related to renovation works; early arrests included contractor directors/consultant; later arrests expanded to scaffolding subcontractors and intermediary.
- ICAC: Probe arrested 8 linked to renovation project (directors, project managers, subcontractors, intermediary); total 11 noted in NBC/AP coverage.
- Materials: Police and officials allege flammable mesh/foam used; some netting initially certified compliant; ongoing verification of actual materials used on-site.
- Non-statutory review: Chief Executive John Lee announced judge-led committee (non-statutory), pledging administrative directives for evidence access; statutory inquiry declined.

## Prior Warnings
- Jason Poon (Pan Zhuohong) flagged non-compliant netting via videos/emails on 2024-05-17; warning video circulated (Facebook).
- Resident complaints in Sep 2024 to Labor Department about flammable netting and foam boards; department initially said netting not regulated, later cited contractor certificates after 16 inspections and issued notices/prosecutions (NYT).

## Open Questions
- Certification vs. installed materials: extent of material swapping; chain of custody for mesh/foam procurement.
- Alarm status pre-fire: whether systems were intentionally disabled during works and by whom.
- Regulatory oversight: adequacy of 16 prior inspections and enforcement actions before November 2025.

## Official Statements and Gaps
- John Lee (Dec 2 presser) acknowledged systemic deficiencies, promised reforms and accountability, and said fires occur globally; condemned “hostile” acts exploiting the tragedy.
