<li>Campus censorship: Baptist University Students’ Union posted mourning posters on Dec 2 reading “沉痛哀悼宏福苑大火死者 / WE ARE HONGKONGERS / 懇請政府從善如流 回應公眾需求 公義得到伸張”; by the next day the university cordoned off the SU board and Democracy Wall with barriers, blocking access to the posters and sparking online criticism that even seeking truth is being curtailed (<a href="https://www.threads.com/@kong.news/post/DRzA_zAEs3a">Threads</a>).</li>

<li>National security arrest (Dec 6): Police NSD arrested a 71-year-old man, reportedly commentator Wong On-yin, for alleged “obstructing national security investigation” under Article 88 and sedition after he posted content from a Dec 2 interview about the fire; police said the disclosure “tipped off” others (<a href="https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E4%BA%94%E7%B4%9A%E7%81%AB%EF%BD%9C%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%89%E8%99%95%E6%8B%98-71-%E6%AD%B2%E7%94%B7%E5%AD%90-%E6%93%9A%E6%82%89%E7%82%BA%E8%A9%95%E8%AB%96%E4%BA%BA%E7%8E%8B%E5%B2%B8%E7%84%B6-%E9%A6%96%E5%BC%95%E7%94%A8%E7%AC%AC88%E6%A2%9D-%E6%9D%8E%E6%A1%82%E8%8F%AF%EF%BC%9A%E6%B6%89%E5%8A%A9%E6%9F%A5%E5%BE%8C%E5%85%AC%E9%96%8B%E5%85%A7%E5%AE%B9%EF%BD%9Cyahoo-114227522.html">Yahoo News HK</a>).</li>

Three charged: (1) one for seditious publications (adjourned Feb 27); (2) Wong Kwok-ngon for seditious videos + obstructing national security investigation (adjourned Feb 23); (3) one for seditious publications (hearing Mar 4). Kan criticizes those who cited "force majeure" (不可抗力) to stop coverage—calling it "unfair" and "smearing" police—saying the real reasons included financial/resource issues or fear of breaking the law. Commissioner Chow Yat-ming warns of "soft resistance," "foreign forces," and fugitive "backflow"; says "a spark can start a fire" (星星之火可以燎原) (<a href="https://www.hk01.com/article/60321528">HK01</a>).</li>

<ul>
<li>“One fire, two systems” framing: ABC analysis says grief and demands for accountability are colliding with Beijing’s red lines—petition organizer arrested, volunteers/NGOs ordered off-site, and residents’ safety complaints rebuffed; argues sovereignty-first governance erodes trust and turns routine civic action into political risk (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-02/tai-po-fire-hong-kong-mainland-grief-red-lines/106087732">ABC EN</a> / <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/chinese/2025-12-02/tai-po-fire-hong-kong-mainland-grief-red-lines/106092864">ABC 中</a>).</li>
<li>Narrative contest on blame: Nikkei Asia op-ed argues officials’ focus on “bamboo scaffolding” is a diversion from systemic negligence—flammable foam/mesh, alarms that failed despite inspections, opaque site logs, and tender/bid-rigging risks. Notes contractor Prestige Construction &#x26; Engineering Ltd. (宏業建築工程有限公司) had prior safety offences and topped consultancy scores despite red flags, cites parallels to the 2010 Shanghai facade fire, and warns shrinking media/legislative oversight lets authorities recast a man-made disaster as accident (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/opinion/the-fire-that-hong-kong-wants-you-to-forget">Nikkei Asia</a>).</li>
<li>National security posture: Beijing’s national-security office warned it would punish anyone “exploiting” the fire for political ends, accused “anti-China” actors of spreading false information, and threatened arrests of those directing anger at the government. A person distributing fliers for an independent inquiry was detained and later bailed (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/hong-kongs-response-to-deadly-fire-is-squeezed-by-chinas-firm-hand-ea01b5a2">WSJ</a>).</li>
<li>Media summons (Dec 6): OSNS summoned senior journalists from outlets including AFP for a “regulatory talk,” claiming foreign media spread false info and smeared relief efforts/elections; officials read a statement, cited no specific stories, took no questions, and warned not to cross “red lines” with the phrase “don’t say we didn’t warn you” (<a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/06/dont-say-we-didnt-warn-you-chinas-nat-sec-office-in-hong-kong-summons-international-media/">HKFP</a>).</li>
<li>Government rebuttal to media: Security Secretary Chris Tang sent a letter to the Wall Street Journal criticizing its editorial on the fire as biased and “ignoring” government support measures, insisting law enforcement must act on alleged crimes and warning against “using the tragedy” (Now News, <a href="https://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=628411">letter coverage</a>).</li>
<li>Campus clampdown update: After earlier poster removals, Hong Kong Baptist University ordered its Students’ Union to suspend operations on Dec 5, citing low representativeness, welfare gaps, and finance-rule issues; it took over the SU office, copy room, and notice boards, giving officers &#x3C;48 hours to clear belongings. HKBU SU condemned the move as unilateral and baseless and said it had already been revising finance rules and planning student events (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1A5Q9xMkQ4/?mibextid=wwXIfr">HKBU SU statement</a>).</li>
<li>Disappearances/online takedowns: Threads/X accounts of Hailey Cheng (a.k.a. 金冬菇, founder of the GitHub “Hong Kong Fire Documentary” project) were removed early Dec 3; her phone unreachable, prompting fears she was taken for questioning over “seditious” information (<a href="https://www.threads.com/@bravedogdog/post/DRxuZY8DOEH?xmt=AQF0lSY3idOhbSWh9l93EEyPuDBCKVB3sWO-7wYF0_7GxA">Threads</a>).</li>
<li>Self-censorship after warnings: After Dec 3 OSNS/HKSAR statements about “foreign forces,” content creators Ellie Yuen (whose explainer amassed ~5.5M views) and Hailey Cheng said on Dec 4 they would stop covering the fire and asked media not to quote them, citing “obvious reasons” and pledges to comply with government appeals (<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2025/12/hong-kongs-grenfell-tower-moment-when-grief-became-sedition/">The Diplomat</a>).</li>
<li>Narrative contest: Global Voices op-ed (Dec 2) says the fire was man-made—rooted in MBIS tender/oversight failures and ignored complaints—and urges an independent inquiry; criticizes scapegoating bamboo and notes student arrest over a petition and pulled Ta Kung Pao bid-rigging reports as evidence of suppression (<a href="https://globalvoices.org/2025/12/02/critics-say-hong-kong-fire-was-due-to-negligence-not-scaffolding/">Global Voices</a>).</li>
<li>International media framing: AP (Dec 2) describes a “tip of an iceberg,” highlighting 7 of 20 net samples failing, alleged cost-cutting net swaps, alarms not sounding, suspension of 28 other projects, and national-security arrests of petition organizers amid concerns of systemic bid-rigging and weak oversight (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-wang-china-dissent-fire-construction-ff953aec2bc0201b0e3255805a241fc1">AP</a>).</li>
<li>Freedoms and suppression: Foreign Policy column argues the fire confirms Hong Kong’s political culture now mirrors the mainland—civil society aid dismantled, petitioners arrested, independent inquiries impossible under NSL—contrasting Grenfell’s scrutiny with Hong Kong’s repression and warning disasters risk being buried in official narratives (<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/12/02/hong-kong-apartment-fire-china-political-freedoms/">Foreign Policy</a>).</li>
<li>UN concern over civic space: UN rights chief Volker Türk says “draconian” security laws are being used on people calling for an independent inquiry and better oversight after the fire; urges dropping those cases and warns cumulative NSL/Safeguarding Ordinance impacts are eroding expression, assembly, and association (<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/12/1166548">UN News</a>).</li>
<li>Missing voices and bamboo scapegoating: Taiwanese outlet Tian Jian reports locals fear bamboo-blame narratives distract from oversight failures and bid-rigging; notes ReNews’ multilingual corrections, PolyU’s Xinyan Huang apologizing for misstatements, Dec 6 Taipei vigil, and rising risk for Hong Kongers speaking to foreign media amid sedition arrests (<a href="https://tian-jian.org/hong-kong-tai-po-wang-fuk-court-fire/">Tian Jian</a>).</li>
<li>Parallel accountability push: HK01 opinion says “ironclad” evidence shows departmental failures (flammable foam sealing windows, fake net certificates, disabled alarms, altered smoke doors) and urges immediate internal probes/discipline at Housing Department, Labour Department, FSD, and Buildings Department instead of waiting for the judge-led committee (<a href="https://www.hk01.com/01%E8%A7%80%E9%BB%9E/60302560/%E5%AE%8F%E7%A6%8F%E8%8B%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%81%AB-%E8%A7%80%E9%BB%9E-%E5%A4%B1%E8%81%B7%E9%90%B5%E8%AD%89%E5%A6%82%E5%B1%B1-%E5%8F%8A%E6%97%A9%E8%BF%BD%E8%B2%AC%E8%A3%9C%E6%BC%8F">HK01</a>).</li>
<li>Cultural defense of bamboo (Dec 5): Artists, architects, and cultural historians circulated multilingual explainers and posts like photographer Elaine Li’s “Leave the bamboo alone,” framing bamboo scaffolding as an intangible cultural symbol (akin to neon signs) and warning against scapegoating the craft after officials ordered scaffold mesh removals citywide (<a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/hong-kong-fire-bamboo-culture-2723917">Artnet</a>).</li>
